I live in what’s called a hall of residence where I
get full board as well as a room. It’s not exactly
what you call cheap, though, I pay £87 per week
for my single room and three meals a day. This
also includes the use of a washing machine and
ironing board. But I can’t complain because my
room has just been re-carpeted, the furniture’s
new and the cleaner comes in daily. The main
drawback is sharing the bathroom with nine other
students and we don’t have any kitchen facilities.
The first thing I did when I arrived was buy
myself a mini-fridge, so I could have cool drinks
whenever I wanted. But, we’re on the university
network, so I have access to the Internet and free
e-mail from my room, and we get room phones
so I can ring friends around the campus for
nothing
