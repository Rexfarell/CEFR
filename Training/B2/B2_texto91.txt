Life is beautifull
It’s sometimes said that you make your own
happiness, and I’ve got some sympathy for that
view. But in my experience, it’s something more
than that. It might sound strange, but I honestly
think it’s all about your life not being too easy. If
everything in your life is handed to you on a plate
by rich parents then I actually don’t think you’re as
happy as someone who’s had to struggle a bit in
their life. When you can share your struggles with
others and laugh about how you got through them,
that’s when you’re truly happy. That’s certainly how
it’s worked out for me.
