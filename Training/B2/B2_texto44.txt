Jump
Well, my friends all said that it was great fun and kept
telling me what a good time I’d have if I joined them,
but I wasn’t convinced until I’d actually done a jump
myself. You see, I’m really scared of heights and,
logically, you think to yourself, what’s the point of this?
After all, all sorts of things can go wrong. Anyway, to
cut a long story short, I ended up doing it as a dare to
impress my girlfriend and, you know what? It wasn’t
anywhere near as bad as I’d imagined.
