Weekend
One weekend my friends persuaded me to go out in one
of the boats that were on the beach. They said that the
owners wouldn’t mind. There was no engine, just two oars
and a couple of buckets. It was rather a heavy boat, so it
took us quite some time to pull it down to the sea and into
the water. After we’d been rowing for just a short time, I
realised why the buckets were there. The sea was coming
in through some small holes. Two of us had to empty the
boat as fast as we could with the buckets, while the third
rowed as quickly as possible back to the beach. Looking
back, it seems really funny, but we were too exhausted to
laugh at the time.
