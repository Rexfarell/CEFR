Looking for a person to...
I wanted people to eat outside and so originally we had a
canvas roof which you could roll back depending on the
weather. It would flap about a bit in the wind, but gave
good protection from the midday sun. But what tended to
happen was that, after a heavy shower, this roof would fill
with water, which at a certain point, given a gust of wind,
would turn back on itself and empty its contents,
splashing the diners beneath. So my son, before he left,
built us this straw roof, but as there are no walls, we still
get just enough sun and breeze.
