City Plan
Even though we had a city plan we got lost several
times – especially in the old town where the
buildings were quite similar – though I know some
people say getting lost is the best way to get to
know a city! We were never short of help, though
– some people were even prepared to walk with
us to show us the way. That was something I’ll
always remember! Our hotel was all right without
being spectacular, and it was a long walk in to
the evening shows – we took a taxi most times.
There was loads to do every day, though, and we
certainly weren’t bored.
