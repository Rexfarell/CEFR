Larry Hale
Larry Hale has a boat that is both his home and
workplace rolled into one. He used to be a deep
sea fisherman, but changed his lifestyle when it
became clear that the fishing industry was in danger
of wiping out the oceansâ€™ fish stocks. Fishing can be
a dangerous but rewarding occupation, and Hale
had made a lot of money over the years. However,
he is now much less wealthy, so he has sold his
house and kept the boat. Hale earns some money
by taking people on whale watching trips or other
wildlife-related excursions.
 Now that everything he owns is on the boat, he
has to be very tidy, otherwise there would be no
room to move around in. He is used to living on
his boat, he says, though he does admit to finding
it hard to cope with the cold on the worst winter
days. Nevertheless, he claims that the lifestyle
suits him, especially the freedom to be wherever
he wants.
