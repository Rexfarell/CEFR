You overhear two friends talking about a restaurant.
M: I can see why people really rate the place.
F: Yeah. They really know how to bring out the flavours in
the different dishes. They also put a lot of thought into
combining unusual ingredients. And as a restaurant it’s not
too stuffy and formal. It’s got a really lively feel about it.
M: Perhaps a little too lively. It was quite hard to hear each
other above the din. I’m not sure it’d be the place to come
for a romantic dinner. Great food though, and so visually
appealing on the plate.
F: They’ve made a lot of effort with that. It really adds to the
experience, doesn’t it?
