Recommendations
Before we went we couldn’t decide where to stay –
so many people recommended different places, and
there seemed to be loads of different and unusual
possibilities, like old traditional farms converted into
guest houses – so we decided to move around and
try something different every couple of nights. That
worked out really well, and they were all excellent.
Although we’d been told that getting round on the
buses was easy and cheap in the city, we decided
to rent a car so that we could get out into the
countryside – we didn’t want to miss out on the
views driving along by the ocean.
