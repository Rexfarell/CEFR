You hear a message on a telephone answering machine.
Oh hi it’s me, John. Sorry to miss you – you must’ve already
left for work. Look, I wondered if you wanted to come away
for the weekend. There’ll be about 10 of us including someone
called Sam Brent who says he was at college with you – and
he remembers that you were brilliant at rock and roll! They’ve
decided it’ll be on October 9, Friday night till Sunday. Anyway,
I’ll put the details in the post. I know you’re busy at the
moment, so don’t feel you have to come, but just let me know
one way or the other when you can. Talk to you soon. Bye.
