You hear two people talking about a programme they saw on TV.
F: Did you watch that programme about the Gobi Desert last
night? I thought it’d be really interesting because it’s a part
of the world I know very little about.
M: The photography was brilliant, wasn’t it?
F: Yes, you could really feel how harsh the life was there.
M: Overwhelmingly grey, I thought. It’d be hard to feel
cheerful living in that landscape.
F: It was a bit short on facts though, wasn’t it?
M: I don’t think it was that kind of programme. They just
wanted you to be amazed at the fantastic landscape. I
guess that’s why there wasn’t much commentary.
F: You’re right. I hadn’t thought of that.
