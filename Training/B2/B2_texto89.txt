Happiness and age
 I sometimes wonder if being happy is something to
do with age. Very young children are happy most of
the time; very old people are happy when they think
of fond memories, and also they’re happy when
they see their grandchildren happy. So happiness is
not just specific to one age group. That’s certainly
the case with my family. But in my experience
happy people get through life more easily – if you
take things seriously all the time, that’s when you
get stressed or have health issues, maybe. And
sometimes life can be a real pain, let’s be honest.
