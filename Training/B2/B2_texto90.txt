Happiness comes in many shapes and forms.
Personally I’m happy when I’m active, doing my
sports and feeling all healthy. But maybe that’s a
rather self-centred view. I also get moments when
I’m just, say, sitting on a train, and suddenly I think
of my children’s smiling faces, and realise how lucky
I am, how happy they make me – and my husband
too, of course. My life could’ve turned out much
worse, as it has for many people. Will I still be
happy when they’ve all grown up and gone away?
I’m sure when that time comes, I’ll find a new form
of happiness
