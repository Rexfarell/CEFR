Dear John,
How are you? I hope everything is going well with you. Do you
remember when you phoned me last time, you told me you needed a job for
this summer. I’ve seen a advertisement in today’s newspaper which is about
an International summer camp and it’s about for 8 to 12 year old children
that I joined last year.
I know at the beginning of that you can think it’s not convinient for
you, but don’t make your decision without hearing about it and what it’ looks
like. Let me tell you about this job.
First of all it’s located in beautiful place in amongs trees, just think
that wonderful nature, brillant wheather and sunshine. It’s stunning place. I
had a great time in that camp last summer. We had a lot of fun during
working hours. Especially outdoor activities, entertaintment, sports
competitions and children’s game are perfect, great and fascinating. We are
staying in tents during summer. Have you ever tried it before? It’s really
different from our houses We have also enough free time for us to go
swimming, fishing, walking on paths and doing nature sports. We are not
working at wekends. I can say that foods are not wonderful but We can go to
town or we can cook our foods in camp kitchen what we want.
At a result of that if you decide to do this job, please let me know as
soon as possible. Because we have short time for applying this job.
I’m looking forward to hearing from you soon
My best wishes,
