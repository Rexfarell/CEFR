Ancient city of York
Every day throughout the summer commencing the 3rd
Saturday in May until the 30th of September, local people
who know something about the origins and development
of the ancient city of York have volunteered to show
visitors around the city and tell them about the old
buildings, historic sites and the people who lived here. For
people interested in the traditional dances of the ancient
inhabitants of this area, there will be a special slide show
at the end of each day.
