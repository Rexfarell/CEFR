Ruth Mars
Ruth Mars is an architect, and one of her most
amazing projects at the moment is her own
house. She originally wanted a chalet in the
mountains, but after buying a large plot on a
mountainside in a remote area, she discovered
that she could not get official permission to build
a house there. After a lot of discussion with the
planning authorities, she got a licence to build her
home in a cave that was in the mountainside.
 Professionally, this presented Mars with an
enormous challenge. She would not have agreed
if she had not been permitted to include some
large windows in the design, and she is proud
to report that this has been achieved without the
windows even being noticeable to casual visitors
to the area. Mars put a great deal of thought into
how she could make the best use of the space
available, and is certainly pleased that the position
of the house in the earth and rock means that it is
easy to heat. What is more, she has won awards
for her house, and is now getting some exciting
new projects to work on.
