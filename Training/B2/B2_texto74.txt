Vacations
We were pretty tired when we first arrived so we
were glad just to relax. We’d booked late and I
have to say that the room wasn’t the best I’ve
stayed in. But we had a view of the lake, which
was a real treat – we were really impressed by the
forests and mountains around the city. We made
good use of the swimming pool, though we were
too lazy to go to the famous markets. We didn’t
take advantage of all the shows either. Lots of people told us how good they were so that was a
pity. And the theatres themselves were supposed
to be impressive.
