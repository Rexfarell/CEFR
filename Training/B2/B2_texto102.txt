A women talking on the phone
… when it rained, water came straight through the roof
and into the bedroom. The bed’s completely ruined. I’ll
have to buy another one – and new bed clothes. I’m sure
the shop won’t be able to replace it exactly. They never
have what I want in stock. It would never have happened if
your employee hadn’t left a hole. And where am I going to
spend the night? I can’t sleep there...
