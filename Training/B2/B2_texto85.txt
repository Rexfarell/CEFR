You hear two friends talking about a student website.
M: The college website is up again. Have you seen it?
F: Yes, they’ve been working on it for a month and it’s
better now. I thought, if they’d got sponsorship from local
companies, there’d be too many advertisements, but it’s OK.
M: Yeah. That’s not a problem. They must’ve got someone in
from the design department to work on it, because there are
some real improvements, it’s not so dull.
F: Especially the artwork on the home page. They want people
to send in ideas so they can change the layout regularly.
M: OK, so long as it doesn’t get too complicated and you waste
time figuring out how to get to the page you want.
Now listen again.
8: You hear a chef talking about taking part in a cookery
competition.
F: How did you find the competition?
M: Tough, but I really enjoyed it. I was convinced the dishes I’d
chosen to prepare would go down well. I decided to focus
on using local ingredients as people nowadays worry a lot
about what they’re eating and it’s really important to know
where the food comes from. It was my first time competing
against others and it was fun being under pressure to come
up with things under strict time limits. I hadn’t expected to
be so worn out though, I think it was having to be on my feet
for so long, but it’s definitely something I’ll do again.
