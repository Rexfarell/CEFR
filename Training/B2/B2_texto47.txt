Recomendations 
Well, I’m afraid that, at your age, your bones aren’t as
strong as they once were. A lot of people with the same
problem need to change their diets or take vitamin
supplements but, from what you say, you already eat the
right foods. What you should do is to get more exercise,
especially outdoors. This doesn’t mean anything drastic
like running a marathon, or going rollerblading. All you
need to do is make sure you go for a nice walk, twice a
day if possible. And, if you can go up and down stairs
instead of taking the lift, that will help you a lot, too.
