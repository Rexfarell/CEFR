Miriam Roses
Miriam Rees lives in a lighthouse on the west
coast of Scotland. Even though the lighthouse
is still in use, it does not have a keeper because
everything is automated. Rees rents the living
quarters and some of the storerooms, and the
only condition is that she has to allow access to
maintenance engineers any time they visit. This is
no hardship, since they are rarely needed.
 Rees really appreciates the fact that she is living
close to nature and far from city crowds. She loves
watching the local wildlife, and she is an artist,
so she enjoys having time and opportunities for
painting. When she wants human contact, she
simply logs on to the Net. She also uses this to
order supplies from the nearest harbour, which
she then collects using her own boat.
 Rees admits that her lifestyle would not suit
everybody, but claims that it is bliss for her.
