You hear two people talking about a film they have both seen.
F: Well, what did you think of that film?
M: I had mixed reactions really. From what I’d read, I expected it
to be funnier.
F: I know what you mean – just shows how different people’s
tastes can be I guess. Good twist at the end though. I wasn’t
expecting that, were you?
M: I kind of guessed what was coming to be honest. There were
a lot of references to other films in the storyline I thought.
F: Oh, you think so? I wasn’t quite sure what message it was
trying to convey, though. One minute it seemed to be saying
one thing and the next it was saying the opposite.
M: Yeah, I agree
