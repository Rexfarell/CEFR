Trip to Central Europe
I was on a cultural tour of Central Europe. One excursion
on our itinerary was a boat trip along the canals that run
through a historic city centre. In theory, I suppose, we
were going to learn something about the city’s beautiful
architecture without doing a lot of walking as we had
on other days. After we’d been sitting in the boat for
some time, I realised that it was rather uncomfortable
with so many people sitting so close together, and we
were so low in the water that we couldn’t see many of
the buildings that we were being told about. The old
man sitting next to me said that he had had more fun
watching paint dry, and I must say I felt the same.
