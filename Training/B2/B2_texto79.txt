You hear a young man talking about his hobby of rock climbing.
It’s not for everyone, but I love the physical aspect. I started
almost by accident – my uncle took me to an indoor climbing
wall and I was hooked. The start of any climb still gives me a real
buzz. I’ve never settled for being less than the best at anything
I’ve tried, and that’s what pushed me to the standard I am now –
which doesn’t mean I don’t think I can still improve! I get a huge
sense of achievement when I finish a particularly demanding
climb, and though other climbers get nervous sometimes, like
when there’s ice, or the weather’s bad, that never puts me off
