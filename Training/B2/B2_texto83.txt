You hear a man being interviewed about a new project he has set up in his home town.
F: Steven, this new environmental project you’re running, what
are you hoping to achieve?
M: Well, Susie, the town I live in, Melbury, is a very pleasant
place to live – clean and tidy. The problem really isn’t
with Melbury as such but is a wider problem – that of the
dangers of rubbish to wildlife. So I got all the retailers in
the town together and showed them a film I’d made on
this subject and as a result they’ve agreed to use paper
bags instead of plastic ones. Recycling was introduced very
successfully last year so I’m hoping that my new project
will have similar success.
