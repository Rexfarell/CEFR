You hear a professional tennis player talking about her career.
Int: Are you ever annoyed by interviewers?
Star: Well, I’m often asked about the financial side
of things. I don’t mind, but I can honestly say,
for many tournaments, I don’t even know what
the prize money is. I just focus on playing to
my full potential. They must find that answer
disappointing! No, the ones I have a problem with
are those who assume it’s all about partying and gossip. 
I wish they’d ask about the real lifestyle;
practising day in, day out, and getting from
tournament to tournament. I probably do around
a hundred long-haul flights a year. It sounds
exciting, but it wipes you out and actually ruins
your social life!
