Remember
You will remember what I’ve already said about the way
I want the information organised in your projects and
how important it is to have a proper introduction and a
conclusion that shows that you’ve really thought about
the subject. I just want to make it clear that, although
it’s important to have plenty of relevant information, the
quality of that information is what counts. Is it from a
reliable source? Is it all true, or has someone just made
guesses that sound good?
