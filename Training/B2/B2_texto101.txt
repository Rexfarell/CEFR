Slimming diet
My friend’s been doing the cabbage soup diet, you know
where you eat almost nothing except cabbage soup for a
week as a way of losing weight. Well, whilst it won’t do her
any harm, there’s no scientific basis for it at all. They’ve
made up rules which are quite hard to stick to and so you
feel that you’re doing something beneficial, which in a way
you are. But, actually if she loses weight, it’ll be because
she’s controlling what she eats – like all such diets, you
know, it will be because she eats less rather than because
of the cabbage itself.
