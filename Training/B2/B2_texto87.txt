What is  happiness?
What is happiness? From an early age happiness
for me is sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake
on a summer’s day and doing some serious fishing
… all alone just me and my thoughts. No stress,
get away from it all for an hour or so, but maybe
not completely aimless – not just lying on a beach
somewhere, but having some task to do. Then,
when it’s all over, it’s back to normal life and
problems and hassle, and having to fight to get
what you want. But that brief moment of happiness
helps me to reflect and make sense of my life.
