The concert
One of my main ambitions was to see inside the
big concert hall – and in fact we managed to get
in to a concert there, which was pretty special.
The acoustics were amazing! The city was divided
by a river, and getting round had its problems,
especially as we didn’t really understand the
city plan. The best way was the ferries – I was
really impressed that they were always on time
and provided good views in the city. The trams
were good too, and the local commuters seemed
happy to chat to us and give us ideas for the best
things to do and see. We didn’t have time to do
everything, though.
