You hear two people talking about a course they have attended.
F: I enjoyed that.
M: It was a bit too businessy for me. I know everything’s about
profits these days, but I still think producing books should be
more about creativity than making money.
F: Everything’s going the same way, whether you like it or not.
A friend of mine did a course on book illustration,
and she said the first lecture was about costs.
M: Anyway, this speaker said if we’re going into the
book trade, we should get practice in as many aspects
as possible.
F: I agree with that. They need an editor for the sports page on
the student newspaper, and I think I’ll go for it.
