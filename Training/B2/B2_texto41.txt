Karl Krenz
Karl Krenz is a professional housesitter. He is
employed by an agency that provides people to live
in the holiday villas of wealthy people who do not
want to leave their properties unoccupied for long
periods of time. Usually, the important thing for the
client is that their house looks lived in. Obviously,
the property needs to be kept clean and tidy, and
sometimes the owner asks for skilled work to be
done where necessary. Krenz is actually a qualified
electrician who can also undertake plumbing and
decorating jobs, so he is in high demand.
 The downside of this job, apart from not having
a home you can call your own, is that it is rare for
the client to permit more than one or two people to
occupy the house. However, these houses often
have luxury facilities like saunas, swimming pools and
games rooms. Krenz tends to view his assignments
as extended holidays with responsibility included.
 He takes his work very seriously. However,
although it is a job that he enjoys, he is considering
finding a new line of work so that he can settle
down and make a permanent home for himself.
