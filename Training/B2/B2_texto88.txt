Be happy
I think to be happy, you do obviously need some
financial security – not rich … I didn’t say that, ’cos
there’s an important difference. Also I’d say you
need humour in your life … that’s kind of obvious
too. Having lots of free time to do what you want?
Not sure, there. I’d say quite the reverse, actually.
For me, you really appreciate your moments of
leisure when you’ve done lots of hard work. If it’s all
play and no work in your life, then you don’t enjoy
it. So for me, it’s all to do with … setting yourself
a list of things to get through and then you’ve
completed them. Now you can be happy.
