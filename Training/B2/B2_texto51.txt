Boat
There were about fifteen of us in each of the small inflatable
rubber boats. Luckily, the captain and crew had managed
to tie them all together so that we didn’t drift apart. We
spent our time nibbling on biscuits and sipping from our
water bottles. Sometimes we sang songs or told each
other stories. Fortunately, it wasn’t a very cold or windy day.
However, we were very uncomfortable until the coastguard
boat arrived after about eight or nine hours. We were lucky
that the captain had been able to contact them before our
plane had sunk to the ocean floor.
