The city
We spent a day exploring the shops and markets
in the city, and bought some souvenirs. Then
we wanted to see some of the area outside the
city, and discovered it was easy to get to loads of
places by train, including the mountains, where
we were told there were great hostels. You can do
bushwalks out there and apparently the scenery
is stunning. But it can be dangerous – we were
warned to have the right gear and tell other people
where we were going. So we decided to give it a
miss. Anyway, we weren’t short of things to do in
the city! We were spoilt for choice
