 You hear a man talking on the radio about salespeople.
M: Professional salespeople can sell anything to anyone and
they do this by using very basic psychological techniques.
Buyers normally have certain requirements by which they
will judge the suitability of a product. The seller therefore
attempts to find out what these conditions are by building a
bond – asking questions about hobbies, family and the like;
but you need to remember, the seller is only interested in
‘closing the deal’. At its most extreme, salespeople will even
attempt to mirror the body language of the buyer. If the
buyer laughs, then so will the seller.
