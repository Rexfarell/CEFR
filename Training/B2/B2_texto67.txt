You hear a poet talking about his work.
I’ve been slowly writing more and more poems for kids over the
last few years. Talking to young people in schools, which I’ve
been doing for some time now, reinforces my belief that they
need and want the same range of subjects that older people do
– relationships, work, family, etc. Often it’s something that only
emerges after my poems are finished, but quite a few of them
in my new collection were first thought of as poems for adults,
until I realised that they might work just as well, or better, for
kids. But I hope it’s a book that adults will enjoy too.
