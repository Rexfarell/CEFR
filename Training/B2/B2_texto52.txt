Our boat
Our boat was exactly the same as any standard 19th
century wooden lifeboat, but we weren’t at sea. We were
tied to our seats wearing virtual reality headphones and
goggles. The boat bounced about and got hit by some
very heavy waves that would have soaked us if we hadn’t
been wearing our waterproofs. The wind was strong and
the thunder and lightning seemed very realistic. Even
more realistic were the screams from some of my fellow
passengers sharing this historical experience.
