You really shouldn’t have done that!
 Oh, you really shouldn’t have done that! I mean,
what can I say? It’s all too much. I never expected
anything like that anyway. I told you not to get
involved on my behalf and that I’d find my own
solutions. And I really meant it! However, here we
are, and you’ve gone and done it anyway. I’d been
expecting to deal with it on my own and now it’s all
been dealt with. I’m at a loss for words, except to
say that this means a lot to me, thanks.
