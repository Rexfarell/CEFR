My neighbourhood
You know, my new neighbourhood’s quite a different
sort of place. As you can imagine, I work really long
hours at my new job, and I’m quite exhausted when I
get home. My neighbours are always bustling around,
talking to each other. They’re always in and out of
each other’s gardens and houses. It’s one big round
of social visits, and the kids are constantly running
wild all around the neighbourhood. They get on
really well with each other, and I must admit they’re
extremely polite when I speak to them. But I don’t
have the energy to accept their invitations and join
them. I suppose that once I’m more settled in and
organised I’ll be able to do that.
