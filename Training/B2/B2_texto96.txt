Dear Jan,
I have already told you about the job I did last summer in the International
Camp for children, do you remember? And this year they are looking for people
for the same job so I have thought about you. Why don’t we do it together?
You will work with children between 8 and 12 and will help with the
organisation of games, sports competitions and outdoor activities. The camp
is situated in a wood, close to a river. It is such a beautiful place! Everybody
sleeps in tents, it is very exciting. And when the children are sleeping, we have
the whole night free to go out and have fun with the staff.
It is a good balance between work and entertainment. We have only 5 hours’
work a day so it gives us enough free time to visit the area and do some
sport activities on our own.
As well as the accommodation, the food is free. It is not wonderful, but it is
not the most important. The contact with children, the feeling of freedom, the
sense of responsibility and the life in the nature make from this camp an
unforgivable experience.
Let me know as soon as possible if you are interested in it, but don’t hesitate
too much, it is worth!
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon
Love,
