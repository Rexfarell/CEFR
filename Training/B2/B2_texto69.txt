You hear two people talking about an ice-hockey game they’ve just seen.
M: So your first live ice-hockey game. Glad you came?
F: Well, I wouldn’t have missed it for the world, but it was
so cold – I had no idea that it would be like that. I wish I’d
brought my thicker coat!
M: That’s normal! At least it was a really exciting game – our
team was doing much better than usual.
F: Well, perhaps that accounts for the noise! I knew it would
be loud, but it was incredible.
M: What do you expect? We have to support them!
F: Well I can say I’ve done it – just don’t expect to see me
here next week …!
