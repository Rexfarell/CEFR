Are celebrities bad for you?
Celebrities are everywhere nowadays: on TV, in magazines, online. Is this preoccupation with famous people harmless fun or is it bad for us? How many people are truly obsessed with modern media idols? And on the other side of the coin, can fame be harmful to the celebrities?
Studies suggest that the vast majority of teenagers do not really worship celebrities. Researchers have identified three kinds of fans. About 15% of young people have an ‘entertainment-social’ interest. They love chatting about their favourite celebrities with friends and this does not appear to do any harm.
Another 5% feel that they have an ‘intense-personal’ relationship with a celebrity. Sometimes they see them as their soulmate and find that they are often thinking about them, even when they don’t want to. These people are more at risk from depression and anxiety. If girls in this group idolise a female star with a body they consider to be perfect, they are more likely to be unhappy with their own bodies.
That leaves 2% of young people with a ‘borderline-pathological’ interest. They might say, for example, they would spend several thousand pounds on a paper plate the celebrity had used, or that they would do something illegal if the celebrity asked them to. These people are in most danger of being seriously disturbed.
What about the celebrities themselves? A study in the USA tried to measure narcissism or extreme self-centredness, when feelings of worthlessness and invisibility are compensated for by turning into the opposite: excessive showing off. Researchers looked at 200 celebrities, 200 young adults with Masters in Business Administration (a group known for being narcissistic) and a nationally representative sample using the same questionnaire. As was expected, the celebrities were significantly more narcissistic than the MBAs and both groups were a lot more narcissistic than the general population.
Four kinds of celebrity were included in the sample. The most narcissistic were the ones who had become famous through reality TV shows – they scored highest on vanity and willingness to exploit other people. Next came comedians, who scored highest on exhibitionism and feelings of superiority. Then came actors, and the least narcissistic were musicians. One interesting result was that there was no connection between narcissism and the length of time the celebrity had been famous. This means that becoming famous probably did not make the celebrities narcissistic – they already were beforehand.
So, what can we learn from this? People who are very successful or famous tend to be narcissists and are liable to be ruthless, self-seeking workaholics. As we can see from celebrity magazines, they are also often desperate and lonely. They make disastrous role models.



Are zoos a good thing?
Zoos are hugely popular attractions for adults and children alike. But are they actually a good thing?
Critics of zoos would argue that animals often suffer physically and mentally by being enclosed. Even the best artificial environments can't come close to matching the space, diversity, and freedom that animals have in their natural habitats. This deprivation causes many zoo animals to become stressed or mentally ill. Capturing animals in the wild also causes much suffering by splitting up families. Some zoos make animals behave unnaturally: for example, marine parks often force dolphins and whales to perform tricks. These mammals may die decades earlier than their wild relatives, and some even try to commit suicide.
On the other hand, by bringing people and animals together, zoos have the potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats. Some zoos provide a safe environment for animals which have been mistreated in circuses, or pets which have been abandoned. Zoos also carry out important research into subjects like animal behaviour and how to treat illnesses.
One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.
However, opponents of zoos say that the vast majority of captive breeding programmes do not release animals back into the wild. Surplus animals are sold not only to other zoos but also to circuses or hunting ranches in the US or South Africa, where some people are willing to pay a lot of money for the chance to kill an animal in a fenced enclosure. Often, these animals are familiar with humans and have very little chance of escaping.
So, are zoos good for animals or not? Perhaps it all depends on how well individual zoos are managed, and the benefits of zoos can surely outweigh their harmful effects. However, it is understandable that many people believe imprisoning animals for any reason is simply wrong.



Choosing a musical instrument
Many people would like to learn how to play a musical instrument, but they are put off by one big problem: what to play? Here are a few questions to help you decide.
What kind of music do you like?
Many instruments are versatile, but some are more suited to certain types of music. Although there is some classical repertoire for the saxophone, for example, people associate it more with jazz, and it is not a permanent feature of many orchestras. Some instruments may lend themselves better than others to the music you like, so consider this before you start.
Do you want to play with other people?
Think about your long-term future as a musician. If you want to play with other people, what sort of instrument would be most practical? The initial attraction of playing a dazzling solo instrument like trumpet, violin, flute or lead guitar might fade when you realise how many other people are competing with you to get the main part with the same instrument! If you want to play rock music, there will always be a demand for bass players or drummers, and if you fancy being part of an orchestra, the bassoon is a great bet to make sure you are always needed.
Where are you going to practise?
Many people live in flats and practising the drums, for example, will drive your neighbours crazy. Think about where and when you are going to practise, as well as the patience of the people you live with or near. Electric versions of instruments like the piano, drums, guitar and even violin give you the option of playing into the night using headphones, while your housemates sleep in peace. Alternatively, you may need to consider going to a school or a community centre to practise.
How much money can you spend?
This is quite a big factor. A lot of instruments can be purchased in different price ranges, for example, guitars. But this doesn’t alter the fact that many, such as the piano, are always pretty expensive. If you can’t afford your chosen instrument, will you be able to borrow someone else’s or hire one?
Are there any physical limitations?
If you’re small and don’t like lifting heavy objects, you won’t want to carry around a double bass. Apart from that, use your common sense, and don’t let your perceived physical shortcomings put you off. Who says small skinny people can’t play the tuba? It’s true that some wind instruments require a lot of lung power but with the right coaching, everyone can develop the right technique.
Still not sure?
Talk to people you know who already play instruments. They might even let you try theirs. It’s also a good idea to find an experienced music teacher, preferably one who plays a few different instruments, who can give you some advice and push you in the right direction.
If you find an instrument you love and that suits your needs, you’ll find the time spent choosing was well worth it. Good luck with making your choice!



FOMO
Everybody knows how important it is for students to get a good night’s sleep every night. You aren’t able to do your best and keep up with all of your responsibilities unless you sleep well. I’m sure you already know that you should go to bed at a reasonable hour. Most experts agree that the optimum number of hours is eight, and this has been accepted as common sense for as long as I can remember. However, I was young once and I know that most of you get much less sleep than that – and in some cases it will be affecting your schoolwork.
I read an interesting article in a teachers’ magazine recently. They did a study of 848 students in Wales. Worryingly, the results showed that teenagers are facing a new problem. They may go to bed and get up at appropriate times but a growing number are waking up in the middle of the night, not to use the bathroom or have a snack but because of a new phenomenon: FOMO – fear of missing out!
According to the article, schoolchildren are suffering because of a growing trend to wake up during the night to check social media. Afraid of missing a comment or opportunity to take part in a chat, teenagers are waking at all times of the night, going online and getting involved. All this when they should be sound asleep.
Experts are worried about this growing trend and the report reveals some worrying statistics that I’d like to share with you:
23% of 12 to 15-year-olds wake up nearly every night to use social media. Another 15% wake up at night once a week for the same reason.
One in three students are constantly tired and unable to function to their full capacity.
Students who use social media during the night are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety.
So, I’d like to ask you to be responsible when it comes to social media. Be brave! Switch off your devices at night. The world won’t end and your social media will be waiting to greet you in the morning! I give you my word that you won't have missed anything important.



Leaving home
Going away to university is always a tricky time, both for the students who are leaving home and their parents who are staying behind. We got advice on how to cope from a student daughter and her dad.
A daughter’s advice to parents, by Kerry Price
My parents drove me to uni at the beginning of the first term. That was great, but then they hung around, so it was hard to chat to the people in the rooms near mine. It’s best if you leave us to unpack ourselves.
Don’t ask us to come home during term time. There’s a lot going on at weekends, there just isn’t time.
Get another interest or a pet if you feel lonely without us. Don’t make us feel guilty about leaving home!
It is quite interesting to hear about your experiences at uni, but remember that it was a LONG time ago so don’t go on about it so much. Things have changed a lot. Now we have a lot more debt and it’ll be harder to find a job in the future.
Please don’t check up on us or our friends on Facebook. I know it’s a public site, but we have the right to some privacy.
Don’t change anything in our bedrooms. We have only half left home - we’ll be back in the holidays, so please don’t touch anything.
We’d still like to come on family holidays with you. Don’t forget to include us just because we’re not there all the time.
A father’s advice to students, by Stuart Price
Don’t complain so much about how much work you have to do. We work a lot too. You’re an adult now, get used to it.
Put up with the fact that we refused to get a dog while you were at home, then suddenly bought one as soon as you moved out. We miss you!
Just because you’re at university studying very complex subjects, it doesn’t mean that you’re more intelligent than everybody else. Don’t treat your family as if they were stupid; we’re really not.
Let us come and visit you now and again. We promise to try not to embarrass you in front of your friends. We just want to see you for a short time and take you out for a meal.
Don’t waste so much time on Facebook. You need time for all that work you have to do, remember?
We might make a few changes to your room, so deal with it. It’s great to have a guest room at last, but we won’t change things too much, promise.
Don’t forget to call home from time to time and don’t get annoyed if we phone you. It’s not pestering. If we didn’t call, you wouldn’t know that we care



The end of life in Earth?
It weighed about 10,000 tons, entered the atmosphere at a speed of 64,000km/h and exploded over a city with a blast of 500 kilotons. But on 15 February 2013, we were lucky. The meteorite that showered pieces of rock over Chelyabinsk, Russia, was relatively small, at only about 17 metres wide. Although many people were injured by falling glass, the damage was nothing compared to what had happened in Siberia nearly one hundred years ago. Another relatively small object (approximately 50 metres in diameter) exploded in mid-air over a forest region, flattening about 80 million trees. If it had exploded over a city such as Moscow or London, millions of people would have been killed.
By a strange coincidence, the same day that the meteorite terrified the people of Chelyabinsk, another 50m-wide asteroid passed relatively close to Earth. Scientists were expecting that visit and know that the asteroid will return to fly close by us in 2046, but the Russian meteorite earlier in the day had been too small for anyone to spot.
Most scientists agree that comets and asteroids pose the biggest natural threat to human existence. It was probably a large asteroid or comet colliding with Earth which wiped out the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. An enormous object, 10 to 16km in diameter, struck the Yucatan region of Mexico with the force of 100 megatons. That is the equivalent of one Hiroshima bomb for every person alive on Earth today.
Many scientists, including the late Stephen Hawking, say that any comet or asteroid greater than 20km in diameter that hits Earth will result in the complete destruction of complex life, including all animals and most plants. As we have seen, even a much smaller asteroid can cause great damage.
The Earth has been kept fairly safe for the last 65 million years by good fortune and the massive gravitational field of the planet Jupiter. Our cosmic guardian, with its stable circular orbit far from the sun, sweeps up and scatters away most of the dangerous comets and asteroids which might cross Earth’s orbit. After the Chelyabinsk meteorite, scientists are now monitoring potential hazards even more carefully but, as far as they know, there is no danger in the foreseeable future.
Types of space rocks
Comet – a ball of rock and ice that sends out a tail of gas and dust behind it. Bright comets only appear in our visible night sky about once every ten years.
Asteroid – a rock a few feet to several kms in diameter. Unlike comets, asteroids have no tail. Most are too small to cause any damage and burn up in the atmosphere. They appear to us as ‘shooting stars’.
Meteoroid – part of an asteroid or comet.
Meteorite – what a meteoroid is called when it hits Earth.



The Facebook party that become a riot
It began as a plan for a very normal 16th birthday party. Merthe Weusthuis wanted a quiet celebration with a small group of friends in her family home in the small Dutch town of Haren. Like many teenagers, she decided to send out invitations via a social network site. But Merthe made one big mistake: she used open-access settings on Facebook, so it wasn’t just her friends who could see details of the event, lots of strangers could too.
The number of invitation acceptances quickly snowballed into an avalanche. Not marking the event as ‘private’ meant the electronic invitation was eventually seen by 240,000 people, of whom 30,000 confirmed online that they planned to attend. To make matters worse, an unauthorised campaign was launched to promote the party by means of a dedicated website and Twitter account, which received hundreds of thousands of hits. The party become known as ‘Project X Haren’ after the 2012 American film Project X in which three high school students throw a birthday party that spins out of control. Video trailers for Merthe’s party were produced, with scenes from Project X edited in, and they were posted on YouTube. T-shirts featuring Merthe’s face were also made, all without her knowledge or consent.
Even after Merthe’s parents had cancelled the party, the publicity didn’t stop. Local media reported on the forthcoming event and teenagers turned up to have their pictures taken outside the Weusthuis family home. On the evening the party was to have taken place, about 5,000 teenagers began gathering in Haren, many outside the Weusthuis house. When it became clear that there was nothing to gatecrash, violence broke out and 500 riot police equipped with helmets, shields and batons were brought in to control the crowd. Shops in the centre of Haren were vandalised and looted, journalists were attacked, cars were set on fire or overturned and street signs and lamp posts were damaged.
However, Facebook was also involved in the clean-up effort in the days after the riot. A group called ‘Project Clean-X Haren’ was set up to gather and organise volunteers. Another group named ‘Suspect-X Haren’ was created to help police identify and arrest the rioters by sharing photos and videos of the event.
A number of other 'Facebook parties’ have spiralled out of control, including the 16th birthday party of British teenager Bradley McAnulty in April 2012. Bradley had not posted details of the event on the internet, and had been careful to ask his friends not to, but somehow the news leaked out and appeared on Blackberry Messenger as well as Facebook. More than 400 gatecrashers invaded his family home in Poole, Dorset, causing extensive damage.



The History of graffiti
The first drawings on walls appeared in caves thousands of years ago. Later the Ancient Romans and Greeks wrote their names and protest poems on buildings. Modern graffiti seems to have appeared in Philadelphia in the early 1960s, and by the late sixties it had reached New York. The new art form really took off in the 1970s, when people began writing their names, or ‘tags’, on buildings all over the city. In the mid seventies it was sometimes hard to see out of a subway car window, because the trains were completely covered in spray paintings known as ‘masterpieces’.
In the early days, the ‘taggers’ were part of street gangs who were concerned with marking their territory. They worked in groups called ‘crews’, and called what they did ‘writing’ – the term ‘graffiti’ was first used by The New York Times and the novelist Norman Mailer. Art galleries in New York began buying graffiti in the early seventies. But at the same time that it began to be regarded as an art form, John Lindsay, the then mayor of New York, declared the first war on graffiti. By the 1980s it became much harder to write on subway trains without being caught, and instead many of the more established graffiti artists began using roofs of buildings or canvases.
The debate over whether graffiti is art or vandalism is still going on. Peter Vallone, a New York city councillor, thinks that graffiti done with permission can be art, but if it is on someone else’s property it becomes a crime. ‘I have a message for the graffiti vandals out there,’ he said recently. ‘Your freedom of expression ends where my property begins.’ On the other hand, Felix, a member of the Berlin-based group Reclaim Your City, says that artists are reclaiming cities for the public from advertisers, and that graffiti represents freedom and makes cities more vibrant.
For decades graffiti has been a springboard to international fame for a few. Jean-Michel Basquiat began spraying on the street in the 1970s before becoming a respected artist in the ’80s. The Frenchman Blek le Rat and the British artist Banksy have achieved international fame by producing complex works with stencils, often making political or humorous points. Works by Banksy have been sold for over £100,000. Graffiti is now sometimes big business.



The history of zombies
Zombies are everywhere these days – on television, in movies and in books. The current image of the terrifying flesh-eating zombie comes from George Romero’s 1968 classic film Night of the Living Dead. Nowadays many people like to frighten themselves with the idea of the ‘Zombie Apocalypse’, and enjoy learning how to destroy zombies by decapitation or shooting them in the head.
However zombies are not new. The term, from the Kongo word nzambi which means ‘spirit of a dead person’, has been long associated with the Vodou religion of Haiti (popularly known as Voodoo). As with West African Vodun, from which it is descended, Vodou has strong ties to the supernatural and magic practised by witch doctors called bokors.
In Haitian culture zombies are not evil creatures but victims. They are said to be people who have been killed by poisoning, then reanimated and controlled by bokors with magic potions for some specific purpose, usually to work as slave labour. The bokors were widely feared and respected. It is said that they used to be in the service of the secret police and those who defied the authorities were threatened with being turned into the living dead.
For a long time most people assumed that zombies were nothing more than mythical figures, like werewolves and vampires. However this changed in the 1980s when a man called Clairvius Narcisse claimed that he had been turned into a zombie by means of drugs and forced to work on a sugar plantation for two years before escaping. Wade Davis, a Harvard scientist, investigated the claim and obtained something called ‘zombie powder’ from Haitian bokors. The main active ingredient was a neurotoxin found in puffer fish which could be used to simulate death. The bokors also explained to Davis that a second poison, made from the datura plant, known as the zombie cucumber, was given to victims after they were revived from their death-like state. This kept the ‘zombies’ in a submissive state so that it was easy to force them to work. Davis wrote several books on the topic, including The Serpent and the Rainbow, later made into a horror film by director Wes Craven.
Although the book was very popular with the public, some scientists were sceptical of Davis’s claims. They said the amounts of toxin in the powder samples he found were inconsistent and not high enough to produce zombifying effects. Although many people in Haiti still believe in zombies, there have been no publicised cases in the last few decades and Davis’s theory remains controversial. The Zombie Apocalypse seems unlikely to take place soon.



Video games are good for you!
For years video games have been criticised for making people more antisocial, overweight or depressed. But now researchers are finding that games can actually change us for the better and improve both our body and mind.
Games can help to develop physical skills. Pre-school children who played interactive games such as the ones available on Wii have been shown to have improved motor skills, for example they can kick, catch and throw a ball better than children who don’t play video games. A study of surgeons who do microsurgery in Boston found that those who played video games were 27 per cent faster and made 37 per cent fewer errors than those who didn't. Vision is also improved, particularly telling the difference between shades of grey. This is useful for driving at night, piloting a plane or reading X-rays.
Games also benefit a variety of brain functions, including decision-making. People who play action-based games make decisions 25 per cent faster than others and are no less accurate, according to one study. It was also found that the best gamers can make choices and act on them up to six times a second, four times faster than most people. In another study by researchers from the University of Rochester in New York, experienced gamers were shown to be able to pay attention to more than six things at once without getting confused, compared with the four that most people can normally keep in mind. Additionally, video games can also reduce gender differences. Scientists have found that women who play games are better able to mentally manipulate 3D objects.
There is also evidence that gaming can help with psychological problems. At the University of Auckland in New Zealand, researchers asked 94 young people diagnosed with depression to play a 3D fantasy game called SPARX and in many cases, the game reduced symptoms of depression more than conventional treatment. Another research team at Oxford University found that playing Tetris shortly after exposure to something very upsetting – in the experiment, a film of traumatic scenes of injury and death was used – can actually prevent people having disturbing flashbacks.
The effects are not always so positive, however. Indiana University researchers carried out brain scans on young men and found evidence that violent games can alter brain function after as little as a week of play, affecting regions in the brain associated with emotional control and causing more aggressive behaviour in the player. But Daphne Bavelier, one of the most experienced researchers in the field, says that the violent action games that often worry parents most may actually have the strongest beneficial effect on the brain. In the future, we may see many treatments for physical and neurological problems which incorporate the playing of video games.



Your digital footprint
Every time you go online you leave a trail. This is just like a real footprint. It reveals where you’ve been, how long you stayed and what you’ve been doing there. Every time you register for an online service, send an email, download a video or upload a photo, the information can be accessed and your digital footprint can be revealed. This shouldn’t necessarily be worrying but it is advisable to be aware of your digital footprint and to be cautious and sensible when you are online.
Six top tips for taking care of your digital footprint
Don’t forget to log off when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. If you don’t, someone can easily pretend to be you!
Don’t tell anyone your passwords and don’t write them down in an obvious place. Make them more complex by using a combination of letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
Tell an adult if you come across anything online that makes you upset, anxious or concerned. There are ways to report inappropriate or abusive content and in most cases web managers respond rapidly.
Remember your favourite websites by using the history button and the bookmark function on your computer or mobile device. This is a way that your digital footprint can work in your favour, but remember to clear your browser history regularly.
If you want to post comments online, you don’t have to use your own name. Invent a nickname to use instead. You can also use a picture instead of a real photo.
Protect your identity online. Be careful about who you share personal information with and always think twice before sharing details like your email, home address, school or phone number with someone.
Think about the future
All kinds of people are interested in your digital footprint. It's now quite common for colleges, universities and employers to check out the online profiles of possible candidates as part of their application process. There are cases of people having missed out on jobs and places in college because their digital footprint didn’t impress the recruiters. So, remember: keep safe, don’t put too much personal information online and always think carefully before you post something. Ask yourself, ‘Would I be happy for absolutely everyone to see this?’



The principles of the New High Protein Diet
This diet is the most effective way of losing body fat. Remember, if we go on a starvation diet, we lose weight but not much fat. In starvation mode, we use up our energy stores of carbohydrate first (in the form of a substance called glycogen). However, the body can store only a little glycogen, and this is used up within two days. Then we start breaking down fat and protein. But we can’t afford to lose body proteins: our muscle mass decreases, we become noticeably weaker, and our immunity is compromised because the lack of protective immunoglobulin proteins means we are subject to an increased risk of infection. Not good!
Sure, we look slimmer, and we certainly weigh less, but we are weaker and becoming unhealthy. There is no point in dieting if it’s going to make us ill. And, of course, because we need our muscles, when we even slightly stray from the diet, our bodies immediately rebuild muscle and we regain all of the ‘lost’ weight very quickly. Yet another diet fails – because it was never going to work in the first place. And we have succeeded in making ourselves considerably less healthy in the process. Not only have we gone through a period of reduced immunity and a lack of proteins, minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and other essential nutrients, there is evidence that so-called ‘yo-yo’ dieting of this nature is detrimental to health in the longer term.
Quite simply, we are going to virtually eliminate all refined carbohydrates and sugars (which are also carbohydrates), leaving us with a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. Of course, you may have heard of high-protein diets before, and they all failed because the carbohydrates were not restricted. Remember, unless you switch off the mechanism to make fat, and switch on the mechanism to burn fat, it is very difficult to lose body fat. On this diet, you will be cutting out virtually all refined carbohydrates so that body fat is burned preferentially, to provide energy. Sugar, starch, white flour, cakes, bread, pasta and rice are the usual culprits. These foods have very little nutritional value and, what’s more, can cause medical and fat problems. Of course, there are forms of these carbohydrates – such as wholemeal rice, wholemeal bread and wholemeal pastas – that do have nutritional benefits and which you can reintroduce later, but in the initial stage of the diet, you have to reduce all carbohydrates, to switch on the fat-burning mechanism.
You should definitely cut out all pasta, rice, cakes and biscuits, and stick to a maximum of one slice of bread per day. Your body will rapidly adjust to a healthy, high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, and will burn body fat. The bottom line is that you don’t need refined carbohydrates and processed sugars. These foods provide energy and no other form of essential nutrition – and when you eat more than the energy you can use immediately the rest is stored as fat. One point to be aware of is that refined carbohydrates can appear in many unexpected sources. You probably know that bread, cakes, pastries, biscuits, pies, pizzas, potato crisps and fried potato chips all contain refined carbohydrates, but pasta, rice, most breakfast cereals, most tinned foods, many pre-packaged foods, tinned vegetables, tinned soups, and prepared sauces do as well… In fact the list goes on and on. Virtually all ‘fast foods’ contain very high proportion of refined carbohydrates – as well as hydrogenated fats – and if your diet is high in refined carbohydrates and hydrogenated fats, you will definitely put on weight. If you’re worried that by cutting out refined carbohydrates you’ll have virtually no foods left to choose from, fear not. In fact, high-protein and nutritious foods such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish and eggs are all open to you, along with vegetables, cheese, spices and herbs, from which you can easily produce delicious, healthy and quick meals. You’ll be relieved to hear that you don’t have to live on a diet of lettuce and tomato. On the contrary, you will be eating virtually limitless; quantities of very tasty food complemented by delicious sauces and dressings: in other words, real food!
What about fats in your diet? I’ve advised you to cut out refined carbohydrates and eat a high-protein diet, but what about the amount of fat you consume? This is going to seem a strange thing to say, and it’s against all of the dietary advice you’ve been given in the past, but if you follow the principles of this diet carefully, you don’t need worry about how much fat you’re consuming. No, I have not gone mad, and I’m certainly not advocating a high-fat diet, but most of the ‘bad’ fats are actually integrated into the sugary, starchy foods you have already excluded, and you will naturally avoid them when you stop eating these foods. So by excluding the refined carbohydrates, you have excluded the ‘bad’ fats from your diet at a single stroke.



Egypt Travel Guide
Courtesy and hospitality are important when doing business in Egypt. The host of a business meeting will usually offer tea or a small snack before commencing. It’s polite to refuse the first offer, but once the host insists, the guest should then accept.
Alcohol is legal, but should be avoided until visitors know their Egyptian colleague’s attitude towards drinking, and, if acceptable, should be drunk in moderation. It is not considered suitable for women to over-indulge in alcohol. If invited to a business lunch, expect food to be lavish and plentiful.
Throughout the Arab world, it is considered bad manners either to display anger or to openly criticize another person in public. Tact and diplomacy are always required. In social life, punctuality is almost laughable. For business, visitors should be on time but expect locals to be often late, and do not take offence. Men should not offer to shake a woman’s hand, and vice versa, unless clearly invited to do so. Men and women should dress smartly for business meetings – suits and tie for men; suit for women or smart trousers/skirt/jacket – and always dress modestly. Shoulders and knees should never be shown.
Economy:
On taking power in 1970, Anwar al-Sadat introduced a policy of infitah (openness) towards investment. Egypt’s economy underwent rapid growth during the 1970s with the quick expansion of the oil industry, tourism and the Suez Canal, and it has continued to expand in subsequent decades.
The tourist sector is expanding rapidly, particularly along the Red Sea and Mediterranean coasts, despite sporadic terrorist activities of Islamic fundamentalists. Agriculture, which relies on irrigation from the Nile, employs one-third of the working population. Foreign aid, especially from the USA, is an important source of government funds.
Internet:
There are internet cafés in the main cities, including Cairo, Alexandria, Dahab and Luxor. Even small, more remote towns including Siwa will have at least one venue, usually in the market area. Connection is usually reliable. Tourists can also access the Internet in hotels, with in-room Wi-Fi available, though often at a costly price.
Media:
The Egyptian press is one of the most influential and widely read in the region, while Egyptian TV and the film industry supplies much of the Arab-speaking world with shows from its Media Production City. Press freedom is encouraged. Press laws which allow prison sentences for libel have encouraged self-censorship on sensitive issues.

 



Are celebrities bad for you?
Celebrities are everywhere nowadays: on TV, in magazines, online. Is this preoccupation with famous people harmless fun or is it bad for us? How many people are truly obsessed with modern media idols? And on the other side of the coin, can fame be harmful to the celebrities?
Studies suggest that the vast majority of teenagers do not really worship celebrities. Researchers have identified three kinds of fans. About 15% of young people have an ‘entertainment-social’ interest. They love chatting about their favourite celebrities with friends and this does not appear to do any harm.
Another 5% feel that they have an ‘intense-personal’ relationship with a celebrity. Sometimes they see them as their soulmate and find that they are often thinking about them, even when they don’t want to. These people are more at risk from depression and anxiety. If girls in this group idolise a female star with a body they consider to be perfect, they are more likely to be unhappy with their own bodies.
That leaves 2% of young people with a ‘borderline-pathological’ interest. They might say, for example, they would spend several thousand pounds on a paper plate the celebrity had used, or that they would do something illegal if the celebrity asked them to. These people are in most danger of being seriously disturbed.
What about the celebrities themselves? A study in the USA tried to measure narcissism or extreme self-centredness, when feelings of worthlessness and invisibility are compensated for by turning into the opposite: excessive showing off. Researchers looked at 200 celebrities, 200 young adults with Masters in Business Administration (a group known for being narcissistic) and a nationally representative sample using the same questionnaire. As was expected, the celebrities were significantly more narcissistic than the MBAs and both groups were a lot more narcissistic than the general population.
Four kinds of celebrity were included in the sample. The most narcissistic were the ones who had become famous through reality TV shows – they scored highest on vanity and willingness to exploit other people. Next came comedians, who scored highest on exhibitionism and feelings of superiority. Then came actors, and the least narcissistic were musicians. One interesting result was that there was no connection between narcissism and the length of time the celebrity had been famous. This means that becoming famous probably did not make the celebrities narcissistic – they already were beforehand.
So, what can we learn from this? People who are very successful or famous tend to be narcissists and are liable to be ruthless, self-seeking workaholics. As we can see from celebrity magazines, they are also often desperate and lonely. They make disastrous role models.



Have we taken security too far?
What’s the difference between a medical student and a convict? The answer: A convict doesn’t pay $50,000 a year for the privilege of being fingerprinted and patted down. I am referring, of course, to the increasingly stringent security measures that have come to characterize modern educational testing. As student evaluation techniques have migrated from face-to-face assessment to computer-based exams administered in dedicated testing centers, evaluators have become less and less likely to know examinees, leading to heightened precautions around exam security.
I recently interviewed a group of fourth-year medical students who had just taken Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Clinical Knowledge Examination at test-administration centers. Each of the students had paid $560 for the privilege, and had devoted nine hours to the single-day exam, which consists of eight sections of 40 to 45 questions each. Over the day, they received a total break time of 45 minutes. Students must pass the exam to obtain a medical license, and scoring well is an important factor in gaining admission to competitive medical specialties. So anxiety tends to run high.
This inevitable anxiety is compounded by Checkpoint Charlie-esque security measures. IDs are checked. Each student wears a unique number on his or her shoulder throughout the day. Students are fingerprinted each time they enter and exit the testing room (up to 16 times). They are patted down and asked to roll up their pants legs and pull their pockets inside-out. If they wear a jacket or sweater into the exam room, they cannot take it off. They are warned that they will be under constant camera surveillance.
One of the students, a former U.S. marine, said he had found the entire atmosphere of the exam eerily familiar. He had served in Iraq, helping to preside over the return of inhabitants to Fallujah after the city’s recapture by U.S. forces. “It was weird,” he said. “They were using many of the exact same procedures and equipment we used in Fallujah. It took so long for them to verify identities that you almost didn’t dare leave the room, for fear you couldn’t get back in time. I finally had to show one of the examiners how to do it properly.” Of course, these techniques are not merely for medical students. Aspiring accountants and architects, students sitting for the GRE, and prospective employees of Silicon Valley companies are all subjected to these medieval measures.
Some might say that a high-security approach to testing students is not only necessary but laudable. In the case of medical testing, the health of the nation is a vital resource, and we cannot afford to place it in the hands of physicians who might have succeeded through academic dishonesty. Who would want a loved one to be cared for by a physician who had cheated on the medical-licensing exam? As public policy, exam hawks argue, we should demand the very highest security in all such testing.
But perhaps we have gone overboard. After all, the core of the patient-physician relationship is trust. The Hippocratic Oath, which has shaped the ethics of medicine for many centuries, enjoins the physician to respect patients’ privacy and dignity and to always put each patient’s interests first. We entrust to our physicians all sorts of matters we would not share with anyone else—private details of our health and personal relationships, access to intimate parts of our bodies, sometimes even our lives. We want to trust our physicians. No one is arguing that security is unnecessary, but perhaps we haven’t quite yet found the sweet spot.



Boston
Jean and her family recently traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, one of America’s oldest colonial cities. Boston is rich in history and local personality. During their visit, Jean and her family appreciated learning about Boston’s role during the American Revolution.
In the city, Jean and her family followed the famous Freedom Trail. This is a 2.5-mile route that tourists can explore in order to visit 16 different historical landmarks located throughout the city. Famous sites on this trail include the Paul Revere House, King’s Chapel, and the Bunker Hill Memorial. Jean and her family received a map to navigate the Freedom Trail. The roads were clearly marked by red lines, and there were signs throughout the city to keep Jean’s family and other tourists from getting lost.
As part of the Freedom Trail, Jean and her family spent a lot of time in Boston’s North End. This is one of the oldest residential neighborhoods in the entire country. Here, Jean and her family were able to visit Boston Harbor, which is the site of the historical Boston Tea Party. This event sent a strong message to the British leading up to the American Revolution.
The end of the Freedom Trail led Jean and her Family to the Boston Common, the oldest urban park in the nation. The park is filled with plenty of lush greenery, but it also serves as a burial ground for heroes of the American Revolution.
Because of their walk along the historical Freedom Trail, Jean and her family left Boston with a thorough understanding of early American history.



Human body parts and organs
It goes without saying that humans (mammals identifiable as those that stand upright and are comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have pretty remarkable bodies, given all that they've accomplished. (Furthermore, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) To be sure, humans have overcome predators, disease, and all sorts of other obstacles over thousands of years.
To fully understand and appreciate these accomplishments, let's take at some of the most well-known parts of the human body!
The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body, has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, orb-like organs that allow humans to see.
The eyes make way for the nose, or an external (sticking-out) organ that plays an important part in the breathing and bacteria-elimination processes. Below that is the mouth, or a wide, cavernous organ that chews food, removes bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, or small, white-colored, pointed body parts used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red-colored, boneless organ used to chew food and speak.
The neck is the long body part that connects the head to the chest (the muscular body part that protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and liquid-processing organs, comes below that.
The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help balance.
Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to grip objects.
The aforementioned shoulders are rounded body parts that aid arms' flexibility. One's back is found on the opposite side of the stomach, and is a flat section of the body that contains important muscles that're intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping humans perform certain motions and actions.



Earth's tectonic plates
Most earthquakes are caused by large-scale movements of the Earth's lithospheric plates. and occur at the boundaries between the plates. Experts recognize seven to twelve major plates and a number of smaller ones. The plates take their names from continents (the North American plate): from oceans (the Pacific plate): and from geographic areas (the Arabian plate).
Slow and Steady Motion
The plates are in very slow but constant motion, so that seen from above, the Earth's surface might look like a slowly moving spherical jigsaw puzzle. The plates move at rates of 2 to 15 cm or several inches in a year, about as fast as our fingernails grow. On a human scale, this is a rate of movement that only the most sophisticated instruments can detect. But on the scale of geological time, it's a dizzying speed. At this rate, those almost-four-billion-year old rocks could have traveled all the way around the Earth eleven times.
The movement of the plates is generally one of three kinds: spreading, colliding or sliding. When plates are spreading, or separating from each other, we call their movement divergent. When they are colliding, or pushing each other, we call the movement convergent. Movement in which plates slide past each other is called lateral (or transform) plate movement. Earthquakes can accompany each of the three types of movement.
Plate Tectonics
The revolutionary theory of plate tectonics originated early in the 20th century, although it did not gain general acceptance until the late 1960s. The German meteorologist, geophysicist, and explorer Alfred L Wegener is now given credit for the first step in understanding the movement of the lithosphere. In the period 1910-1912 he formulated the theory called continental drift and collected evidence from the rocks, fossils, and climate of various continents to show that they had once been joined together. Wegener had little data on the oceanic crust, so he thought that the continents merely moved through that crust.



The domestication in cats
For centuries, the common view of how domestication had occurred was that prehistoric people, realizing how useful it would be to have captive herds of food animals, began capturing wild animals and breeding them. Over time, by allowing only animals with "tame" characteristics to mate and produce offspring, human beings created animals that were less wild and more dependent upon people. Eventually this process led to the domestic farm animals and pets that we know today, many of which would fare quite badly in the wild, having lost their ancient survival skills and instincts.
Recent research suggests that this view of domestication is incomplete. Prehistoric human beings did capture and breed useful wild animals, and those species became tamer over time (they generally changed physically, too, developing larger bodies and smaller brains than their wild cousins). But specialists in animal behavior now think that domestication was not simply something people did to animals - the animals played an active part in the process. Wolves and wild horses, for example, may have taken the first steps in their own domestication by hanging around human settlements, feeding on people's garbage and crops and getting used to human presence and activity. Individual animals that were not too nervous or fearful to live near people produced offspring that also tolerated humans, making it easier for people to capture and tame them.
In this version, people succeeded in domesticating only animals that had already adapted easily to life around humans. Domestication required an animal that was willing to become domestic. The process was more like a dance with two partners than a triumph of humans over animals.
At first glance, the taming of cats seems to fit nicely into this new story of domestication. A traditional theory says that after prehistoric people in the Near East and Egypt invented agriculture and started farming, rats and mice gathered to feast on their stored grain. Wildcats, in turn, gathered at the same places to prey on the rats and mice. Over time, cats got used to people and people got used to cats, until at some point cats were tame. New studies of wildcats, however, seem to call this theory into question. Wildcats don't share hunting and feeding territories, and they don't live close to people or seek out human settlements as food sources. Experts do not know whether wildcats were partners in their own domestication. They do know that long after people had acquired domestic dogs, sheep, goats. cattle, and horses, they somehow acquired tame cats. By mating the least aggressive cats with one another, they produced animals with increasingly tame qualities.



The Constellations
Constellations are patterns of stars in the sky. Over many thousands of years, human beings living on the Earth have looked up and seen the shapes of people, animals and everyday objects - they 'joined the dots' of the stars to form patterns in the sky. They gave these shapes names, some of which we still use today. But why did they bother with constellations at all? One reason is that having constellations makes it easier to find your way around the sky. This is useful for finding north, or working out the date or the time. When there were no compasses, clocks or watches, this was all very important.
There is another reason why constellations were so important. Imagine going back to a time before paper and pencil had been invented. Life was sparse. If you wanted to draw a picture, you had to scratch it out on a dark cave wall or write it in sand that could blow away. But at night an amazing pattern of bright specks of light would appear above your head. By joining the dots you could see almost any picture you wanted. You could imagine seeing your favourite shapes in the sky. You might tell others about the constellations you have made up. They might tell others, and your constellation could be passed down from generation to generation for hundreds or even thousands of years. This is how many of the constellations got the names we use.
Seasons
You don't see exactly the same part of the sky every night, though between one night and the next you won't see much of a difference. Over a few weeks you'll definitely notice that you can see some constellations that you couldn't see before and some constellations that you could see aren't there any more. This is because the Earth is moving around the Sun. As the Earth moves round in its orbit, the night side of the Earth (the side facing away from the Sun) faces out to different parts of space, where there are different constellations.
This means that you see different constellations in different seasons. Orion and Taurus are (Northern Hemisphere) winter constellations, because you can see them on winter evenings. Cygnus and Scorpius are (Northern Hemisphere) summer constellations, because you can see them on summer evenings.
Naming The Constellations
So who made up the constellations and their names? The earliest people on the Earth were hunters and gatherers. They looked up into the sky and saw shapes that were important to them - like Orion the Hunter. Much later in human history, English farmers looked up into the sky and saw the shape of a Plough. Russian peasants, looking at the same group of stars, called it Ursa Major or The Great Bear. People in France called it Le Casserole meaning the Saucepan. People in the USA called it The Big Dipper meaning a soup ladle. All of these different names are used today. The only people who have decided on one set of names for the constellations are the astronomers. For example, they always call the Plough 'Ursa Major', and never any of the other names. They had to do this so that they all knew what other astronomers across the world were talking about.
The stars in a constellation have nothing to do with each other; they can be very, very far apart, even if they appear to be right next to each other in the sky. Imagine looking up while standing in a street. You might see your hand next to a street light, which is next to the Moon, which is next to a planet, which is next to a star. All of these things are far away from each other, yet they can be next to each other when you look at them.
If you like, you can look up into the sky, join the dots and make up your own constellations. Tell other people about your constellations. Maybe one day people all around the world will be using one of your constellation names!



The History of Time
If you can read a clock, you can know the time of day. But no one knows what time itself is. We cannot see it. We cannot touch it. We cannot hear it. We know it only by the way we mark its passing. For all our success in measuring the smallest parts of time, time remains one of the great mysteries of the universe. One way to think about time is to imagine a world without time. There could be no movement, because time and movement cannot be separated. A world without time could exist only as long as there were no changes. For time and change are linked. We know that time has passed when something changes.
In the real world, the world with time, changes never stop. Some changes happen only once in a while, like an eclipse of the moon. Others happen repeatedly, like the rising and setting of the sun. Humans always have noted natural events that repeat themselves. When people began to count such events, they began to measure time. In early human history, the only changes that seemed to repeat themselves evenly were the movements of objects in the sky. The most easily seen result of these movements was the difference between light and darkness.
The sun rises in the eastern sky, producing light. It moves across the sky and sinks in the west, causing darkness. The appearance and disappearance of the sun was even and unfailing. The periods of light and darkness it created were the first accepted periods of time. We have named each period of light and darkness: one day.
People saw the sun rise higher in the sky during the summer than in winter. They counted the days that passed from the sun's highest position until it returned to that position. They counted three hundred and sixty-five days. We now know that is the time Earth takes to move once around the sun. We call this period of time a year.
Early humans also noted changes in the moon. As it moved across the night sky, they must have wondered: Why did it look different every night? Why did it disappear? Where did it go? Even before they learned the answers to these questions, they developed a way to use the changing faces of the moon to tell time. The moon was "full" when its face was bright and round and "new" when it was almost entirely dark. The early humans counted the number of times the sun appeared between full moons. They learned that this number always remained the same, about twenty-nine suns. Twenty-nine suns equalled one moon. We now know this period of time as one month.
Early humans hunted animals and gathered wild plants. They moved in groups or tribes from place to place in search of food. Then, people learned to plant seeds and grow crops. They learned to use animals to help them work, and for food. They found they no longer needed to move from one place to another to survive. As hunters, people did not need a way to measure time. As farmers, however, they had to plant crops in time to harvest them before winter. They had to know when the seasons would change. So, they were forced to developed calendars. No one knows when the first calendar was developed. But it seems possible that it was based on moons, or lunar months.
When people started farming, the wise men of the tribes became very important. They studied the sky. They gathered enough information so they could know when the seasons would change. They announced when it was time to plant crops.



A revolutionary photo
It is perhaps the most reproduced, recycled and ripped off image of the 20th Century. Che Guevara, his eyes framed by heavy brows, a single-starred beret pulled over his unruly hair, stares out of the shot with glowering intensity. It's now more than 50 years since the Argentine-born rebel was shot dead, so any young radicals who cheered on his revolutionary struggles in Cuba and Bolivia are well into middle age.
But the image has been infinitely repeated - emblazoned on T-shirts and sprayed on to walls, transformed into pop art and used to wrap ice-creams and sell cigarettes - and its appeal has not faded. "There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?" asks Trisha Ziff, the curator of a touring exhibition on the iconography of Che. "Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level - whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalisation," she says.
The unchecked proliferation of the picture - based on a photograph by Alberto Korda in 1960 - is partly due to a political choice by Korda and others not to demand payment for non-commercial use of the image. Jim Fitzpatrick, who produced the ubiquitous high-contrast drawing in the late 1960s as a young graphic artist, said he actively wanted his art to be disseminated.
"I deliberately designed it to breed like rabbits," he says of his image, which removes the original photograph's shadows and volume to create a stark and emblematic graphic portrait. "I was determined that the image should receive the broadest possible circulation," he adds.
For Ms Ziff, Che Guevara's murder also marks the beginning of the mythical image. "The birth of the image happens at the death of Che in October 1967," she says. "He was good-looking, he was young, but more than that, he died for his ideals, so he automatically becomes an icon."
The story of the original photograph, of how it left Cuba and was carried by admirers to Europe before being reinterpreted in Mr Fitzpatrick's iconic drawing, is a fascinating journey in its own right. Alberto Korda captured his famous frame on 5 March 1960 during a mass funeral in Havana. A day earlier, a French cargo ship loaded with ammunition had exploded in the city's harbour, killing some 80 Cubans - an act Fidel Castro blamed on the US. Korda, Fidel Castro's official photographer, describes Che's expression in the picture, which he labelled "Guerrillero Heroico" (the heroic fighter), as "encabronadao y dolente" - angry and sad. Unpublished, the picture was seen only by those who passed through Korda's studio, where it hung on a wall.
One man who brought the image to Europe was the leftist Italian intellectual, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, who distributed posters across Italy in 1967. After that, Korda's photograph made an appearance in several European magazines. Mr Fitzpatrick first came across a tiny version of it in the German weekly. Only months later, when he finally got his hands on a larger version of the photograph, was he able to produce the image that has such universal appeal. "I'd got an original copy of the image sent to me by a guy involved with a group of Dutch anarchists, called the Provo."
After Che Guevara's death, an outraged Mr Fitzpatrick furiously reprinted originals of the poster and sent it to left-wing political activist groups across Europe. Part of his fury stemmed from vivid memories working behind a bar in Ireland as a teenager, and seeing Che walk in. The revolutionary was briefly exploring the homeland of his Irish ancestors during a stopover on a flight to Moscow. "I must have been around 16," Mr Fitzpatrick remembers. "It was a bright, sunny morning. I knew immediately who he was. He was an immensely charming man - likeable, roguish, good fun and very proud of being Irish."
Mr Fitzpatrick's version of Che arrived on the continent as many countries were in a state of flux, says Ms Ziff. "His death was followed by demonstrations, first in Milan and then elsewhere. Very soon afterwards there was the Prague Spring and May '68 in France. Europe was in turmoil. People wanted change, disruption and rebellion and he became a symbol of that change."
As time went on, the meaning and the man represented by the image became separated in the western context, Ms Ziff explains. But in Latin America, she points out, Che Guevara's face remains a symbol of armed revolution and indigenous struggle. Combining capitalism and commerce, religion and revolution, the icon remains unchallenged, Ms Ziff says. "There is no other image that remotely takes us to all these different places."



In search of Bigfoot
In the Himalayas there's an old Sherpa saying that, "There is a Yeti in the back of everyone's mind; only the blessed are not haunted by it." Many cultures have legends about solitary man-beasts, and recorded sightings in North America and Asia date back to the early 1800s. Despite numerous sightings, photos and footprints of often questionable origin, there has never been conclusive proof that these creatures exist. No droppings, no bones, no hair and no bodies found - alive or dead.
And this week, geneticists at the University of Alberta are putting the legend to the test as they scrutinise hair alleged to have come from Bigfoot. The results are due on Thursday. The hair was collected by residents in Teslin, Yukon, who claim to have found it in a massive footprint left behind by a 3m-tall human-like creature which walked through their gardens earlier this month.
Wildlife geneticist Dave Coltman expects that the hair will have come from a known mammal such as a bear or bison, but says he is curious enough to test this theory. "If Bigfoot is indeed a primate, then we would expect the sample to be closer to humans or chimpanzees or gorillas. That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?"
Man-Beast Or Myth
Regardless of his findings, the myth of Bigfoot does not need hard facts to persist. The creatures are real enough to those who say they have spotted them, but opinion is divided on the nature of the beast. Some say it is flesh-and-blood; others, including various Native American tribes, believe it to be a spirit being which appears to humans in times of crisis. Ralph Gray Wolf, an Athapaskan Indian from Alaska, has told reporters that Sasquatch makes appearances to help troubled communities "get more in tune with Mother Earth", bringing a message that there is a need to change.
Nor are such creatures confined to the vast, isolated tracts of land in North America and Asia - in the UK, such legends date back centuries. Two years ago, investigators and the media descended on Bolam Lake, near Newcastle, following a spate of sightings of a tall, shadowy figure over the previous 18 months. In their week in the wooded, lakeside park, six of the party spotted the so-called Beast of Bolam. Richard Freeman, of the Centre for Fortean Zoology centre, says one of his colleagues was among the witnesses.
"What they saw was not Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as I prefer to call him; it was an enormous shadowy figure in the trees, more like a ghost than flesh-and-blood. In a park not far from a city centre, you're not going to get a nine-foot ape-like creature - England doesn't have the habitat to support it." His theory is that sightings such as this - and Scotland's Big Grey Man of Ben MacDhui and the Grey King in Wales - are of a paranormal being. "I don't mean that these are the ghosts of some creature which has died; I think it is more complex than that."
In his time as a professional monster hunter, Mr Freeman has travelled the world gathering tales of weird and wonderful creatures - and in every culture, the same types crop up time and again. He calls it the "international monster template", which is made up of dragons and other huge reptiles; large ape-like creatures, such as Sasquatch and the trolls of Medieval Europe; little people, such as fairies and goblins; giant birds; and phantom dogs and cats. "I believe these are equivalents of the creatures which inhabited the plains of Africa millions of years ago, which our ancestors would have had to deal with. We now have a fossil memory of these creatures. Under certain conditions, the human mind creates 3D images of these equivalents."
Mind Games
Sceptics such as Benjamin Radford, of the Skeptical Inquirer magazine, also believe that such sightings are our minds playing tricks on us. For it is actually very easy to fool ourselves into believing what we want to believe. What often happens, he has said, is that out in the wilderness, in areas known as Bigfoot locations, someone will see something dark or hairy or fast out of the corner of their eye that startles them. "If they're already thinking that there's a Bigfoot in the area, it's easy to make the leap between saying: 'I saw something, I don't know what it is,' to: 'I saw something and it's Bigfoot.'"
As for the latest find, it will soon be known whether the hair is from a creature thus far unknown to science. And until then, the truth simply lies in the eye of the beholder.



Three South American Leaders
Juan Domingo Perón
Juan Domingo Perón was an Argentine military officer and politician. After serving in several government positions, including those of Minister of Labour and Vice President of the Republic, he was three times elected as President of Argentina, serving from June 1946 to September 1955, when he was overthrown by a coup d'état, and from October 1973 to July 1974.
During his first presidential term (1946-1952), Perón was supported by his second wife, Eva Duarte ("Evita"), and the two were immensely popular among many Argentines. Eva died in 1952, and Perón was elected to a second term, serving from 1952 until 1955. During the following period of two military dictatorships, interrupted by one civilian government, the Peronist party was outlawed and Perón was exiled. When the left-wing Peronist Hector Cámpora was elected President in 1973, Perón returned to Argentina and was soon after elected President for a third time. His third wife, María Estela Martínez, known as Isabel Perón, was elected as Vice President on his ticket and succeeded him as President upon his death in 1974.
Juan and Evita Perón are still considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the Justicialist Party.
Salvador Allende
Salvador Allende was a Chilean physician and politician, known as the first Marxist to become president of a Latin American country through open elections.
Allende's involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years. As a member of the Socialist Party, he was a senator, deputy and cabinet minister. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race, formally elected by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority.
As president, Allende adopted a policy of nationalization of industries and collectivization; due to these and other factors, increasingly strained relations between him and the legislative and judicial branches of the Chilean government (who did not share his enthusiasm for socialization of Chile) eventually culminated in a declaration of a "constitutional breakdown" by the parliament. On 11 September 1973 the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état. As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, Allende gave his last speech vowing not to resign. He was killed later that day.
Following Allende's deposition, army General Augusto Pinochet declined to return authority to the civilian government; and Chile became ruled by a military junta that was in power from 1973 to 1990, ending almost 48 years of Chilean democratic rule. The military junta that took over became known for persecuting dissidents extensively.
Simón Bolívar
Simón Bolívar was a Venezuelan military and political leader. Bolívar played a key role in Latin America's successful struggle for independence from the Spanish Empire, and is today considered one of the most influential politicians in the history of the Americas.
Following the triumph over the Spanish monarchy, Bolívar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Hispanic-America, a republic, now known as Gran Colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Despite ordering widespread atrocities in his Decree of War to the Death, Bolívar is regarded as a hero, visionary, revolutionary, and liberator in Hispanic-America.
During his lifetime, he led Venezuela, Colombia (including Panama at the time), Ecuador, Peru (together with Don José de San Martín), and Bolivia to independence. Admirers claim that he helped lay the foundations for democracy in much of Latin America.
On 17 December 1830, at the age of forty-seven, Simón Bolívar died after a painful battle with tuberculosis in Santa Marta, Gran Colombia (now Colombia). On his deathbed, Bolívar asked his assistant, General Daniel F. O'Leary to burn the remaining, extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches. O'Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a wealth of information about Bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his long love affair with Manuela Sáenz.



Three Wild Cats
The Leopard
The leopard is a member of the Felidae family with a wide range in some parts of Africa and tropical Asia, from Siberia, South and West Asia to across most of sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as Near Threatened because it is declining in large parts of its range due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade and pest control.
Compared to other members of the large cat family, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but is smaller and more slightly built. Its fur is marked with rosettes similar to those of the jaguar, but the leopard's rosettes are smaller and more densely packed, and do not usually have central spots as the jaguars do.
The species' success in the wild is in part due to its opportunistic hunting behavior, its adaptability to habitats, its ability to run at speeds approaching 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph), its unequaled ability to climb trees even when carrying a heavy carcass, and its notorious ability for stealth. The leopard consumes virtually any animal that it can hunt down and catch. Its habitat ranges from rainforest to desert terrains.
Most leopards avoid people, but humans may occasionally be targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but injured, sickly, or struggling cats or those with a shortage of regular prey may resort to hunting humans and become habituated to it. Although usually slightly smaller than a human, an adult leopard is much more powerful and easily capable of killing them.
The Lion
With some males exceeding 250 kg in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.
The lion is a vulnerable species. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
Lions live for 10-14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to the forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal.
The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "king of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness, as well as a symbol of bravery.
The Bobcat
The bobcat is a North American wild cat, appearing around 1.8 million years ago. With 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, forest edges, and swampland environments. It persists in much of its original range, and populations are healthy.
With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the Lynx genus. It is about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.
Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from insects, chickens, and small rodents to deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.
Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient. The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.



Four Sports
Cricket
Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each who score runs (points) by running between two sets of three small, wooden posts called wickets. Each of the wickets is at one end of a rectangle of flattened grass called the pitch. Around the pitch is a much larger oval of grass called the cricket ground. The edge of the cricket ground is often marked by a rope. If a player hits the hard red ball to the rope, he gets four runs. If it gets past the rope without hitting the ground, he gets six runs which is the most runs you can get with one shot.
The game started in England in the 16th century. The earliest definite reference to the sport is in a court case of 1598. The court in Guildford heard a coroner, John Derrick, that when he was a scholar at the "Free School at Guildford", fifty years earlier, "he and diverse of his fellows did run and play [on the common land] at cricket and other players". Later, the game spread to countries of the British Empire in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Baseball
Baseball is a sport played on a field by two teams against each other. In baseball, a player on one team throws a small round ball at a player on the other team, who tries to hit it with a bat. Then the player who hits the ball has to run around the field. Players score points by running around in a full circle around three markers on the ground called bases, to back where they started, which is called home plate. They have to do this without getting caught by the players on the other team.
Baseball started in the United States in the 1700s and 1800s, but historians are not sure who invented it. Many people in North America, South America, and East Asia play baseball, but the sport is most popular in the United States and Japan. In the U.S., baseball is called the national pastime, because so many people in the United States used to spend a lot of time playing or watching baseball games. Today, though, most Americans follow football more than baseball, especially when it comes time for the Super Bowl.
Badminton
Badminton is a sport for two or four people. The game is either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net.
The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back properly before it hits the floor. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point. They also get to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets.
Badminton traces its history to a game called George Cajoles, which was played in Pune, India in the 19th century by the British military officers stationed there. This game was taken by retired officers back to England where it developed and quickly grew in popularity.
In 1877, the first set of written rules were arranged by the newly formed Bath Badminton Club. The All England Open Badminton Championships, the first badminton competition in the world, was held in 1899. Badminton has been an Olympic sport since 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Although badminton originated in England, it is mainly played in countries of Asia such as China, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea that now dominates this sport.
Basketball
Basketball is a handball game usually played by two teams of five players on the court. A basketball is a spherical object that rolls and bounces. The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a backboard at back end. It is a very popular sport worldwide, played with a round and usually orange ball that bounces. Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and jumping.
The game is played between men's teams or between women's teams. Basketball has been played in the Summer Olympic Games since 1936. The shot clock rule started in 1954. The first basketball game took place in 1892, where the court was half the size of what it is today.
In early December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian physical education teacher at Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts invented an indoor game called basketball. He invented the sport to keep his students from becoming bored during the winter. Naismith wrote the basic rules and then nailed a peach basket onto a 20-foot tall pole. Unlike modern basketball hoops, the bottom of the peach-basket was still there, so after a point was scored, somebody had to get the ball out of the basket with a long stick. Over time, people made a hole at the bottom of the basket so the ball could go through more easily.



Four Hotels Review
The Yarborough
Well, where do I start? We booked a long weekend away and I had requested a quiet room as we're not into the late night revelry. We arrived early and the duty manager offered to put our bags in storage to allow us the chance to get out and about without the hindrance of our luggage. We returned at 2 pm to check in where all was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The duty manager allocated us room 329 on the 3rd floor.
Wow, what a room, we have stayed in many 5-star hotels and this was on par with all of them. It was absolutely immaculate. The bedroom was large and comfortable, the air conditioning was a touch of luxury given the standard of hotel and there was a quality TV with crystal clear pictures. Iron and ironing board in the room and even bottled water to compliment the hot drinks selection. We both enjoyed the lunches and breakfasts that we ate here, very tasty and very reasonably priced and the service was second to none. Despite the restaurant and bar being constantly busy, all the staff members had time to smile and chat to you. I would have preferred a buffet breakfast, but that is a small thing.
The hotel is located adjacent to the railway station and ideally placed for shopping in the town centre. This is a real hidden gem of a hotel good and at only £49 per night was excellent value for money. I will definitely return to this hotel for our next visit to Grimsby in the summer when we are having a big anniversary party. We will be singing its praises to all of my friends, family and work colleagues. Thank you to all at the Yarborough.
Humber Royal
My fiancé and I came to stay at The Humber Royal Hotel. After meeting with Melissa, the owner, we instantly felt comfortable and reassured that our wedding would be in good hands! Unlike most wedding venues, there was absolutely no pressuring us into making any decision and every detail that we requested was listened to. Vanessa dedicated a lot of time and effort into making us feel comfortable and assured us that no corners would be cut and put together a beautiful plan together for our special day.
The rooms are to a very high standard, very spacious and excellent value for money. Our room had an excellent view of the harbour too, which we weren't expecting. We stayed for an evening meal within the venue, the service was incredible and the food was absolutely delicious. Excellent value for money! We can't wait to show off our venue to our family and friends and to spend our wedding day with the staff at The Humber Royal.
The St. James
Stayed here for Valentine's Day. We eventually found our room through the labrynth of corridors and thought it was OK. Nothing more, nothing less. Around 7pm, there was very loud music which we soon realised was the live music performance downstairs. We didn't have to leave the room to experience the entertainment as could hear every word in the bedroom! We could even hear people's conversations from the street below! We went down for the meal at 8pm and that was lovely, I couldn't fault it whatsoever. When we mentioned the loud music to our waiter, he acted as if he didn't believe us!
We went back to the round around 10pm and the music was louder than ever and went on for another hour or so. I understand it's for everyone else's benefit that was still down there but to hear every song as clear as day is just ridiculous! The bed felt as though it had been there for fifty years, with springs in your back when you move and very noisy. All in all, the worst night's sleep we've ever had!
Partly we're glad we stayed as we wanted to book our wedding here for next year, but definitely will not be doing so now! Will not be recommending nor returning!
Healing Manor
This hotel is not quite as dog friendly as we had hoped and as a result should be more described as a hotel with dog-friendly rooms. Firstly you cannot take your dog to breakfast, you have to leave them behind in the room, or for no extra charge you can have room service but there are no table and chairs in the room to eat your food at.
The rooms were clean and a good size. The shower was amazing, probably the best shower I have had in years! The bed was a little bouncy for my liking and I have to say I'm never a fan of a double room that is actually two beds pushed together - those beds just are not comfortable for two cuddlers!
We received a handwritten note and some macaroons to wish us a Happy New Year, which was a lovely touch. The grounds of the hotel are stunningly beautiful and I bet make the perfect setting for a wedding.
On checking out, we noticed a few errors with our bill that we questioned and they rectified immediately. Just annoying that the errors were there in the first place.
In short, decent value overall but rooms are a bit tired and in need of care and think their dog policy in the main hotel could do with being reviewed. Why not offer dog-friendly breakfast in the Pig and Whistle pub, which is undoubtedly the jewel in your crown?



Four Letters to Neighbours
Darren
Hello, it's Darren at number 6. I've noticed three times this week that our parking space has been taken. I've mentioned this before and you kept to your own space for a few weeks. Last week, your daughter's red Fiat was in our space for the whole of Sunday afternoon. I know she visits you every weekend and it's not always easy to find somewhere to park. But it's equally unfair to cause problems to us. My mother-in-law came to visit on the same day and she had to park quite some distance away. I will contact the council if this happens again. One other thing I wanted to mention, it's just a silly thing but it drives my wife crazy. There's a small hole in the fence between our two gardens and our Tommy has got through there into your garden three or four times. Maybe he's been chasing your cat! I think I'm right in believing that fence is your legal responsibility, so could you get that hole fixed as soon as possible. I would hate to think what would happen if Tommy went out of your gate, which is usually open, and got onto the road.
Samantha
Hi, my name is Samantha and I live on the floor below you. I wanted to chat to you this morning, but there was no answer when I knocked on the door. I've only been here for a couple of weeks, so wouldn't like to cause any problems. It's just that someone in your place is playing music very loudly. I understand you have a son who's about sixteen years old: perhaps it's him? The problem is that his room is directly above my young daughter's bedroom and it means she can't sleep with so much noise. The other night, the music was being played after midnight and she was woken up and got very confused and frightened about what was happening. She's only six years old! We don't expect to live in a library and it's normal to expect a certain level of noise when there are so many people living close together. I would just like to request that the volume is kept down a little and that music is not played too late. I will come round and try to speak to you face to face about this at the weekend.
Terry
Hello, Terry at number 42 again. I'm tired of writing these silly little notes to you. Yes, it's your cat again! If you don't do something about this problem, I will report you. If it was up to my wife, this would have already happened! This whole situation is becoming ridiculous. I am not responsible for telling you about your sick cat every few weeks. Do something or I can report you for animal cruelty. I went out into our garden the other night, about midnight, and your poor cat was on our lawn once again. It looked very ill and it had obviously been sick. Your cat is not old and you told me last time that it didn't have any known condition, so why does it keep coming into our garden in such a state? Only two weeks ago, my young son found your cat in our shed and he ran into the house in tears. Please take your cat to the vet and get it checked out, it clearly has something wrong with it and I don't want to see it in our garden anymore.
Debbie
Hello Mr. Alston, it's Debbie your neighbour. I was told that I should write to you about this problem, so that I have something in black and white. As I have mentioned before, your apple tree is starting to cause real problems with the wall that runs between our two properties. I think it's the roots. That is what an expert told me. He said the roots were very close to the surface and they were starting to damage the wall. We paid a lot of money to build that wall less than three years ago and you will remember, at the time, we told you the tree was going to cause problems. You told me that if that happened, you would do something about the tree, perhaps to cut it down. Well, here we are three years later and the wall is being very much damaged. What are you going to do about it? My husband said if nothing is done, he will be going to the council to force you to get rid of the tree. I would prefer it doesn't come to that point and that you will see sense and help us avoid a bigger issue.

Three Magicians
Harry Houdini
He began his magic career in 1891. At the outset, he had little success. He performed in sideshows, and even doubled as "The Wild Man" at a circus. Houdini focused initially on traditional card tricks. At one point, he billed himself as the "King of Cards". But he soon began experimenting with escape acts.
In 1893, while performing with his brother, Dash, at Coney Island as "The Brothers Houdini", Harry met a fellow performer, Wilhelmina Beatrice "Bess" Rahner. She and Houdini married in 1894, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as "The Houdinis." For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess would work as his stage assistant.
Houdini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager Martin Beck in rural Woodstock, Illinois. Impressed by Houdini's handcuffs act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe. After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini managed to interest Dundas Slater, then manager of the Alhambra Theatre. He gave a demonstration of escape from handcuffs at Scotland Yard, and succeeded in baffling the police so effectively that he was booked at the Alhambra for six months.
Derren Brown
Derren Brown is a British illusionist, mentalist, trickster, hypnotist, painter, writer, and sceptic. He is known for his appearances in television specials, stage productions, and British television series such as Trick of the Mind and Trick or Treat. Though his performances of mind-reading and other feats of mentalism may appear to be the result of psychic or paranormal practices, he claims no such abilities and frequently denounces those who do. Brown states at the beginning of his Trick of the Mind programmes that he achieves his results using a combination of "suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship".
Brown was born to Bob and Chris Brown in Purley, Croydon, London, England. He has a brother, who is nine years his junior. Brown was privately educated at Whitgift School in South Croydon (where his father coached swimming), and studied Law and German at the University of Bristol. While there, he attended a hypnotist show by Martin Taylor, which inspired him to turn to illusion and hypnosis as a career. Whilst an undergraduate, he started working as a conjuror, performing the traditional skills of close-up magic in bars and restaurants. In 1992, he started performing stage shows at the University of Bristol under the stage name Darren V. Brown.
Brown was an Evangelical Christian in his teens, and became an atheist in his twenties. Brown said he sought to strengthen his belief and provide answers to common criticisms of religion by reading the Bible and other Christian religious texts, but upon doing so found none of the answers he sought and came to the conclusion that his belief had no basis.
Joseph Dunninger
Dunninger was born in New York City. He headlined throughout the Keith-Orpheum Circuit, and was much in demand for private entertainment. At the age of seventeen he was invited to perform at the home of Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay and at the home of the inventor Thomas A. Edison, both of whom were avid admirers of his mysticism.
Dunninger was a debunker of fraudulent mediums. He claimed to replicate through trickery all spiritualist phenomena. He wrote the book Inside the Medium's Cabinet which exposed the tricks of mediumship. He also exposed how the indian rope trick could be performed by camera trickery.
Dunninger had a standing offer of $10,000 to anyone who could prove that he used paid assistants for his tricks. He often said he could raise that offer to $100,000. Through Scientific American magazine and the Universal Council for Psychic Research, Dunninger made this offer to any medium who could produce by psychic or supernatural means any physical phenomena that he could not reproduce by natural means. Dunninger appeared on radio starting in 1943, and on television frequently in the 1950s and 60s.



Social networks
Business applications
Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to expand their contact base. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world.
Medical applications
Social networks are beginning to be adopted by healthcare professionals as a means to manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. The role of social networks is especially of interest to pharmaceutical companies who spend approximately "32 percent of their marketing dollars" attempting to influence the opinion leaders of social networks.
Languages, nationalities and academia
Various social networking sites have sprung up catering to different languages and countries. The popular site Facebook has been cloned for various countries and languages and some specializing in connecting students and faculty.
Social networks for social good
Several websites are beginning to tap into the power of the social networking model for social good. Such models may be highly successful for connecting otherwise fragmented industries and small organizations without the resources to reach a broader audience with interested and passionate users. Users benefit by interacting with a like-minded community and finding a channel for their energy and giving.
Business model
Few social networks currently charge money for membership. In part, this may be because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as MySpace and Facebook sell online advertising on their site. Hence, they are seeking large memberships, and charging for membership would be counter productive. Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provide. Sites are also seeking other ways to make money, such as by creating an online marketplace or by selling professional information and social connections to businesses.
Privacy issues
On large social networking services, there have been growing concerns about users giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services need to be aware of data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as MySpace, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken.
Investigations
Social network services are increasingly being used in legal and criminal investigations. Information posted on sites such as MySpace and Facebook, has been used by police, probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites. In some situations, content posted on MySpace has been used in court.



She
She knew the street backwards, of course. How many times had she been dragged up it as a child by the wrist, whining and snivelling, always wishing she were somewhere else?  Now she had no desire to be anywhere but here.  This bustling traffic, these fuming buses, these chipped paving stones and boarded-up shop fronts, they were hers.  Here, she would grow from defiant teenager to independent woman.  When she was an old woman, she would gaze out over the lawns and say ‘Ah, Knox Road, that’s where I really came into my own’.
Number 126 was only a short walk from the bus stop, and she heaved her multiple bags onto her shoulders and trudged off, trying to maintain the elation as the straps dug into the flesh of her neck and fingers.  Number 126 was set back slightly from the main road, with a concrete path and weed-patch at the front.  The window frames were rotten and the paint chipped.  Holly tried not to mind.  It was what was inside that counted, after all.  The coming-together of six individuals from diverse backgrounds. discussing politics, culture and art late into the night, sharing ideas, recipes, milk, shower gel and lovers – that would be what she’d look back on of course, not the paintwork.  In the absence of either a bell or knocker, she rapped firmly on the door.
There was no reply. Holly peered through gap in curtains in the downstairs window, but there was nothing but gloom within.  She could hear a faint thudding of a bass beat, but was not sure which house it belonged to.  She rapped more firmly, and was searching for a pebble to throw to the upstairs window when the door opened. A shirtless, overweight twenty-something, with bleary eyes and greasy hair stood in the doorway wearing boxer shorts and mismatched socks.
“I’ve come for the upstairs room, I’m the new tenant,” said Holly brightly.
The man grunted slightly and moved aside. He gestured up the dim, uncarpeted stairway and began to shuffle along the dark hallway to the rear of the house.
“Top floor, is that right?  I guess I just follow my nose!” Holly gave a high laugh, and received another grunt in reply. Then the man was gone.
Not to worry, he must be the quiet moody type, thought Holly, too caught up in his own profound thoughts for inane chit-chat.  One day she would penetrate his hard outer shell and release the free spirit inside.  Anyway, now for the stairs.
The four flights of stairs would be worth it, she’d decided when she picked out the flat, even if it did mean her going downstairs to get to the bathroom, because the room faced the front, and she could watch the world scurry by as she sipped her morning coffee.  Kicking one bag in front and dragging the others behind, she finally made it up the four flights and flung open the door to her new room, her new haven, her new adult life. 
Peeling beige wallpaper, a lumpy mattress on a chipboard bedframe, a bare light bulb, a flat-pack wardrobe inexpertly put together.  All this, Holly could just about put up with, but when she saw the view from her window – a dull patch of grey sky, invariable whatever the angle, she finally had to admit to herself that her adult life was not getting off to a great start.



Extract
Six months ago I made a rash promise. The leader of the youth club in our village rang me in March saying, ''We're thinking of running a children's playscheme for a day in October half-term. Would you be prepared to help?'' My response was ''Sure, why not?'' In truth I was a little flattered to be asked, even though working as a care assistant with old people hardly qualified me for the role. Still, I duly put the date in my diary and of course I forgot all about it. I don't know if you've noticed this but time has a habit of speeding along faster than a police car chasing a robber and, before I knew it, the day was dawning.
I arrived at the youth centre that morning feeling full of trepidation. There was a gang of 12 helpers including me and each pair had been allocated a particular age group. Mine was the 10 to 11 year olds. Even with the planning meeting I had attended the week before, I worried about whether I was up to the task. Why hadn't I read through the copious lesson plans we were given beforehand? And wasn't the average 10-year-old more interested in the latest Play Station game than making things with paper and glue?
All too quickly the children began arriving. The look of relief on parents' faces as they handed their offspring over to us was quite comical. A handful of the children were already members of the club but the other forty five or so were from the local primary schools. Again I asked myself why I had elected to spend a day with all these 'little monsters' especially when I have two all of my own to contend with! I needn't have worried of course as it turned out to be a marvellous day. We watched entertaining dvd clips, learned 'action' songs, made clay pyramids, decorated biscuits, played memory games and spent some time in quiet reflection. I say 'we' because I rediscovered my inner child and joined in all the activities.
The particular highlight for me was the final rendition of ''He's got the whole world in his hands'' in the closing part of the day. The children knew the words and actions off by heart and sang so loudly it was almost enough to bring the roof down. It's difficult to explain those moments; only that the body tingles with the pleasure of having witnessed something so magical.
Of course there were also moments of great poignancy. I found it difficult to stop thinking of one little girl, who mentioned oh-so-casually that her mum was in hospital and would be there for a long time. It's easy for us adults to idealise childhood and forget that some children have their own burden of anxieties and concerns. When I got home utterly exhausted, still with modelling clay under my fingernails, I reflected on what a privilege it had been.
There was one disappointment for the children and that was that the playscheme was only running for a day, and not the whole week. As I said farewell to my group, one of the children turned and said ''Can we do it again in the next holiday, Miss?'' My response was, ''Sure, why not?''




Be web wise
Protect your computer, by all means, but don't forget to protect yourself, advises web safety expert, Amanda Knox.
We're always being urged to stay safe online. But in an era where the internet is part of our everyday lives - for work, fun, study, shopping, even managing finances - it's not always easy to spot the dangers. Web safety expert, Amanda Knox, explores some of the issues lurking in cyberspace.
Her first piece of advice is to install software and a firewall to protect your computer from viruses, hackers and criminals who want to steal your data or financial information. ''Think of these as your first line of defence,'' says Amanda.
So much for protecting yourself against intruders, but what about other problems? Say you've accidentally deleted an important file or you've been at the mercy of a natural disaster. Katy Marsh runs an online photography business from home and when a fire destroyed part of her house it could easily have spelled ruin for her business too. ''Luckily I keep a regular back-up of my data so it wasn't a catastrophe.'' Amanda advises that while back-ups are good to have we must ensure we protect our computers to start with.
Whilst most of us are aware of the need to protect our computers, it seems we're more lax when it comes to looking out for ourselves, at least according to a recent web awareness survey. Web safety specialists say better personal awareness is needed and this is due in part to the rise of 'Social Networking' sites like 'Facebook' or 'Twitter', which allow us to connect with people around the world with similar interests and professional backgrounds. Chris Simpson, a computer programmer, learnt the hard way. "I joined a free online networking group in the hope of making some professional contacts to help me find a new job. After a month, one of my online contacts invited me to take out a subscription to a club that promised access to a network of job recruiters. It turned out to be a waste of money. I ended up a laughing stock with my mates - they couldn't believe that someone in my job could get taken in so easily." No wonder then that Amanda warns, "It's easy to get complacent and let our guard down when we meet someone with the same interests online."
This brings us to other potential pitfalls. Are the people you meet online who they really claim to be? Can you be sure the person you're chatting with is in fact a 22-year-old Maths undergraduate from London and not someone merely masquerading as a student to win your trust? Khaled, a postgrad from Manchester University, quickly realised that it was unwise of him to post his phone number and email address in the public forum of an online academic discussion group. He was soon bombarded with unwanted emails and nuisance phone calls. Yet, it's astonishing how many highly educated people do this without considering the consequences that anyone in the world could use the information to make (unwanted) contact.
When networking and joining online communities it's better to be cautious about the amount of personal information you share. For example, it isn't always necessary to use your real name as a username when registering for a service. You could instead use a pseudonym, or a name that doesn't give away your real identity to other users. And is it really important to tell the world details about your school, college or any local clubs you're a member of? Sometimes it pays to be a little vague and simply say something like 'I'm studying at college in Madrid at the moment and I'm a member of a local tennis club'.
If you do experience problems from another user be prepared to report them for misusing the service. You'll be doing other users a favour too. And if all else fails, check to see if it is easy to delete your account and leave the service if you choose to and that you have the option to delete all your details. A general rule of thumb is not to post any information about yourself that you would not be happy for the world to know - not just now but in years to come. This includes photographs of yourself, particularly embarrassing shots of you at that party which you may later regret! It's not always easy to remove information after it's been posted so you - not to mention your future employer - may have an unpleasant surprise a few years down the line.




BURGLARY AND HOW TO AVOID IT
A recent survey of crime statistics shows that we are all more likely to be burgled now than 20 years ago and the police advise everyone to take a few simple precautions to protect their homes.
The first fact is that burglars and other intruders prefer easy opportunities, like a house which is very obviously empty. This is much less of a challenge than an occupied house, and one which is well-protected. A burglar will wonder if it is worth the bother.
There are some general tips on how to avoid your home becoming another crime statistic. Avoid leaving signs that your house is empty. When you have to go out, leave at least one light on as well as a radio or television, and do not leave any curtains wide open. The sight of your latest music centre or computer is enough to tempt any burglar.
Never leave a spare key in a convenient hiding place. The first place a burglar will look is under the doormat or in a flower pot and even somewhere more 'imaginative' could soon be uncovered by the intruder. It is much safer to leave a key with a neighbour you can trust. But if your house is in a quiet, desolate area be aware that this will be a burglar's dream, so deter any potential criminal from approaching your house by fitting security lights to the outside of your house.
But what could happen if, in spite of the aforementioned precautions, a burglar or intruder has decided to target your home? Windows are usually the first point of entry for many intruders. Downstairs windows provide easy access while upstairs windows can be reached with a ladder or by climbing up the drainpipe. Before going to bed you should double-check that all windows and shutters are locked. No matter how small your windows may be, it is surprising what a narrow gap a determined burglar can manage to get through. For extra security, fit window locks to the inside of the window.
What about entry via doors? Your back door and patio doors, which are easily forced open, should have top quality security locks fitted. Even though this is expensive it will be money well spent. Install a burglar alarm if you can afford it as another line of defence against intruders.
A sobering fact is that not all intruders have to break and enter into a property. Why go to the trouble of breaking in if you can just knock and be invited in? Beware of bogus officials or workmen and, particularly if you are elderly, fit a chain and an eye hole so you can scrutinise callers at your leisure. When you do have callers never let anybody into your home unless you are absolutely sure they are genuine. Ask to see an identity card, for example.
If you are in the frightening position of waking in the middle of the night and think you can hear an intruder, then on no account should you approach the intruder. Far better to telephone the police and wait for help.




The Truth About Kids and Tech
A new study reveals some surprises about kids and technology
Common Sense Media, a non-profit group focused on helping children, parents and teachers better
understand media and technology, has conducted a study. It looked at a wide range of media-related
activities, from old methods like reading and listening to the radio, to new favorites like using social
media and video chatting. More than 2,600 kids from around the country were surveyed. Here are
some facts that the study revealed about tweens (8 to 12 years) and teens (13 to 18 years)



The Truth About Kids and Tech
A new study reveals some surprises about kids and technology
Common Sense Media, a non-profit group focused on helping children, parents and teachers better
understand media and technology, has conducted a study. It looked at a wide range of media-related
activities, from old methods like reading and listening to the radio, to new favorites like using social
media and video chatting. More than 2,600 kids from around the country were surveyed. Here are
some facts that the study revealed about tweens (8 to 12 years) and teens (13 to 18 years)



How a 16-Year-Old Girl Started a Multimillion Dollar Social Network
1. Juliette Brindak started a social networking site for tweens when she was 16, and it’s doing
better than ever. Miss O and Friends generates 10 million monthly visits, a twenty-fold increase
from its inception in 2005. It’s also worth around $15 million, according to early investor Procter
& Gamble. When she was ten, Brindak drew characters for a set of five friends she called “Cool
Girls,” who were all inspired by real-life girls. The main cool girl, Miss O, represents her younger
sister Olivia. The set of “Cool Girls” would eventually become “Miss O and Friends.” 
2. In the beginning — like many startups — Brindak reached out to family members and friends for
investment money. Her mother, a graphic designer, brought her drawings to life while her father,
who has a background in business, aided in the fundamentals of creating the company. What
started out as a few sketches on the way home from a family vacation quickly ballooned into a
haven for millions of adolescents. The site was ranked the third largest girls-only Web site in
2011, according to Inc. Magazine.
3. Now, at 23, Brindak isn’t as in tune with what tween girls are looking for, so she uses the site as
an avenue to understand their needs. Through polls, quizzes, and the “Girl2Girl” wall, members
are able to keep Brindak updated. “In November 2011, girls were writing on the Girl2Girl wall
asking if we could get them tickets to a One Direction concert. This was the first time we ever
heard about One Direction and we were able to create a concert/sponsorship with Simon &
Schuster’s ‘Dork Diaries’ books and winning tickets.” She’s made it possible — through contests
— for her users to see celebrities, such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, in
concert. Currently, she’s offering an all-expense paid trip to Canada for four lucky fans to see
Taylor Swift’s show.
4. Through high school and college, the site has continued to improve. When it was originally
launched, there was little more than a few catchy graphics. “There was a homepage, which had
the five Miss O characters and simple flash animations,” Brindak says. “There was hardly
anything to it, but it was definitely a start.” Now the site boasts message boards, quizzes,
games, music, and more.
5. But managing the site as a college student at Washington University in St. Louis was no easy
task. “One teacher, who ironically was an entrepreneur and taught my class on social
entrepreneurship, was the only one who wouldn’t budge about dates. I had a final on the same
day I had to fly out to California for a really important meeting and he said that if I missed it, I
would get an entire letter grade taken off my final grade. Luckily, the meeting got moved, but I
was so shocked about his reaction.”
6. Instead of the typical business majors most entrepreneurs study, Brindak decided to focus on
Anthropology and Public Health because her site revolves around women’s health issues. “I was able to learn so much about cultures around the world and also become informed and
aware about different ways that I can reach out to women,” Brindak says. “The goal for the site
was, and still is, to help young girls build confidence and self-esteem.”
7. To share her users’ stories with the world, Brindak published the book Miss O & Friends: Write
On! The Miss O & Friends Collection of Rockin’ Fiction, a compilation of user-submitted stories.
Brindak tells us she plans on publishing more books in the near future. “We started off with a
business plan that we have used as our guide, but that business plan is always changing. We
continue to find new ways to engage girls, to generate revenue, and new outlets that are
appropriate for Miss O and our community.”



Novel
The bus was crowded with tourists, most of whom, like us, were unfamiliar with local customs
and probably unsure of which stop to get off at. It was the middle of summer, and we were
already hot and tired, even though it was still morning. The bus had no air conditioning and,
as there weren't any free seats, we'd been standing for at least twenty minutes as the
rusty old vehicle made its way along the winding, bumpy roads. It was an effort for us to
keep our balance and not fall down or bump into other passengers as the bus went round
sharp bends or swerved to avoid the numerous holes in the road.
Because there were so many people around us, it was difficult to see out of the windows,
so we weren't quite sure where we were. Thinking, after the bus had crossed a bridge, that
we had reached the ancient site that we wanted to visit, we pressed the button by the door
to let the driver know that we wanted to get off at the next stop. When the bus stopped
and the doors opened, however, we realised that the site was still a long way off, and so
we stayed on board. No one got off the bus. The doors closed and the bus set off again.
Just before the next stop, another passenger must have pressed the button, because, on
reaching the stop, the bus once more came to a noisy halt and the doors opened with a
loud rattle. However, once again, no one got off. We had been too busy chatting to see
who it was who had pressed the button and, unaware of our predicament, we continued our
conversation. However, after a few moments, we realised that the bus hadn't set off again.
Sensing that something was wrong, all the passengers turned and looked in the direction of
the driver.
To our horror, the enormous bus driver had got out of his seat, obviously with some effort,
since he was bright red, and was heading straight towards us with a face like thunder.
He stopped a few metres from us and started shouting at the top of his deep, booming
voice. His voice matched his expression perfectly. Perhaps fortunately, we didn't speak the
language, so we understood nothing of what he was yelling. We realised that he was angry
with us because the button had been pressed twice, forcing him to stop the bus for no
reason since nobody had got off.
`Sorry, sorry,' I said, trying to sound as apologetic as possible, and with a pained expression
on my face.
`We're really sorry,' my friend added, `but we only did it once. It wasn't us the second time.
It must have been someone else. We weren't sure where to get off, you see and ....'
Her voice gradually trailed off as she saw the blank look on the bus driver's face. There was
obviously no reason to continue. He looked even angrier than before – if that was possible.
Still fuming, he turned round and got back into his seat. The bus set off again. We thought
it wise to move away from the door so that we wouldn't be blamed if someone pressed the
button a third time. We were pretty sure that if it happened again, we would be physically
thrown off the bus - at best!
Eventually, we arrived at our destination, not a moment too soon, we felt, and we got off
the bus with a great sense of relief. As the vehicle moved off, we could just make out,
through the cloud of dust that it left behind, a group of boys who were standing at the
rear window. They were looking at us and laughing. We wondered if we had been the victims
of a practical joke.
`Oh, well, let's just hope we don't get on the same bus on the way back!' my friend remarked
as we headed for the wonders of the ancient ruins which were still some way ahead of us.




Miriam Roses
Miriam Rees lives in a lighthouse on the west
coast of Scotland. Even though the lighthouse
is still in use, it does not have a keeper because
everything is automated. Rees rents the living
quarters and some of the storerooms, and the
only condition is that she has to allow access to
maintenance engineers any time they visit. This is
no hardship, since they are rarely needed.
 Rees really appreciates the fact that she is living
close to nature and far from city crowds. She loves
watching the local wildlife, and she is an artist,
so she enjoys having time and opportunities for
painting. When she wants human contact, she
simply logs on to the Net. She also uses this to
order supplies from the nearest harbour, which
she then collects using her own boat.
 Rees admits that her lifestyle would not suit
everybody, but claims that it is bliss for her.



Larry Hale
Larry Hale has a boat that is both his home and
workplace rolled into one. He used to be a deep
sea fisherman, but changed his lifestyle when it
became clear that the fishing industry was in danger
of wiping out the oceans’ fish stocks. Fishing can be
a dangerous but rewarding occupation, and Hale
had made a lot of money over the years. However,
he is now much less wealthy, so he has sold his
house and kept the boat. Hale earns some money
by taking people on whale watching trips or other
wildlife-related excursions.
 Now that everything he owns is on the boat, he
has to be very tidy, otherwise there would be no
room to move around in. He is used to living on
his boat, he says, though he does admit to finding
it hard to cope with the cold on the worst winter
days. Nevertheless, he claims that the lifestyle
suits him, especially the freedom to be wherever
he wants.



Ruth Mars
Ruth Mars is an architect, and one of her most
amazing projects at the moment is her own
house. She originally wanted a chalet in the
mountains, but after buying a large plot on a
mountainside in a remote area, she discovered
that she could not get official permission to build
a house there. After a lot of discussion with the
planning authorities, she got a licence to build her
home in a cave that was in the mountainside.
 Professionally, this presented Mars with an
enormous challenge. She would not have agreed
if she had not been permitted to include some
large windows in the design, and she is proud
to report that this has been achieved without the
windows even being noticeable to casual visitors
to the area. Mars put a great deal of thought into
how she could make the best use of the space
available, and is certainly pleased that the position
of the house in the earth and rock means that it is
easy to heat. What is more, she has won awards
for her house, and is now getting some exciting
new projects to work on.



Karl Krenz
Karl Krenz is a professional housesitter. He is
employed by an agency that provides people to live
in the holiday villas of wealthy people who do not
want to leave their properties unoccupied for long
periods of time. Usually, the important thing for the
client is that their house looks lived in. Obviously,
the property needs to be kept clean and tidy, and
sometimes the owner asks for skilled work to be
done where necessary. Krenz is actually a qualified
electrician who can also undertake plumbing and
decorating jobs, so he is in high demand.
 The downside of this job, apart from not having
a home you can call your own, is that it is rare for
the client to permit more than one or two people to
occupy the house. However, these houses often
have luxury facilities like saunas, swimming pools and
games rooms. Krenz tends to view his assignments
as extended holidays with responsibility included.
 He takes his work very seriously. However,
although it is a job that he enjoys, he is considering
finding a new line of work so that he can settle
down and make a permanent home for himself.

Jump
Well, my friends all said that it was great fun and kept
telling me what a good time I’d have if I joined them,
but I wasn’t convinced until I’d actually done a jump
myself. You see, I’m really scared of heights and,
logically, you think to yourself, what’s the point of this?
After all, all sorts of things can go wrong. Anyway, to
cut a long story short, I ended up doing it as a dare to
impress my girlfriend and, you know what? It wasn’t
anywhere near as bad as I’d imagined. 



My neighbourhood
You know, my new neighbourhood’s quite a different
sort of place. As you can imagine, I work really long
hours at my new job, and I’m quite exhausted when I
get home. My neighbours are always bustling around,
talking to each other. They’re always in and out of
each other’s gardens and houses. It’s one big round
of social visits, and the kids are constantly running
wild all around the neighbourhood. They get on
really well with each other, and I must admit they’re
extremely polite when I speak to them. But I don’t
have the energy to accept their invitations and join
them. I suppose that once I’m more settled in and
organised I’ll be able to do that.



Remember
You will remember what I’ve already said about the way
I want the information organised in your projects and
how important it is to have a proper introduction and a
conclusion that shows that you’ve really thought about
the subject. I just want to make it clear that, although
it’s important to have plenty of relevant information, the
quality of that information is what counts. Is it from a
reliable source? Is it all true, or has someone just made
guesses that sound good?



Recomendations 
Well, I’m afraid that, at your age, your bones aren’t as
strong as they once were. A lot of people with the same
problem need to change their diets or take vitamin
supplements but, from what you say, you already eat the
right foods. What you should do is to get more exercise,
especially outdoors. This doesn’t mean anything drastic
like running a marathon, or going rollerblading. All you
need to do is make sure you go for a nice walk, twice a
day if possible. And, if you can go up and down stairs
instead of taking the lift, that will help you a lot, too.



You really shouldn’t have done that!
 Oh, you really shouldn’t have done that! I mean,
what can I say? It’s all too much. I never expected
anything like that anyway. I told you not to get
involved on my behalf and that I’d find my own
solutions. And I really meant it! However, here we
are, and you’ve gone and done it anyway. I’d been
expecting to deal with it on my own and now it’s all
been dealt with. I’m at a loss for words, except to
say that this means a lot to me, thanks.



My school
The village school was originally just one small stone
building, built in the early 1870s and, unlike many
modern schools, it was on a large piece of land, which
meant that it had an enormous grassy playground.
By the time I started school, two cheaply-constructed
modern extensions had been added to the original
building. On one side were two extra classrooms, and
on the other was a kitchen and dining area where we
had lunch.
As in many small villages, we often had two or three age
groups in one classroom because of the small number
of pupils in each year. In my first year, for example, my
class sat together with the second and third years in the
headteacher’s classroom. Many of our lessons were
the same for all the class, though the teacher obviously
had higher expectations of the older children. Strange
though it may seem, I used to think that the third-year
children were almost grown-up then.
Most of us walked to school, but the children who didn’t
live nearby, especially those who lived on farms a few
kilometres away, cycled to school. I remember being
very impressed by those who could ride a bike and hold
a football in both hands at the same time! 
We weren’t allowed to stay indoors during the breaks,
but we had plenty of room to run around on the grass,
playing football and games like tag. The girls preferred
the tarmac in front of the school, where they could play
games or have skipping competitions. When it rained, we
stayed in the shelter shed, a large wooden building that
was open on one long side. There, we had to be content
with talking or climbing up the walls.
There was only one little cottage beside the school,
which we had to stay away from because the owner was
very proud of his beautiful garden. The rest of that side
of the playground was separated from a field by a wire
fence. I remember one morning break when a lot of us
were leaning against the fence watching as a pony gave
birth to its foal. It was an amazing experience. On the
other side of the school was a stream which became a
river when it overflowed on really rainy days. We had to
stay away from that because there was a steep drop of
several metres from the playground wall to the stream.
At the back of the school was part of the local golf
course, and less than fifteen minutes’ walk across the
golf course was the beach. Of course, on school days I
could only dream about going there.
Only once did we go to the beach during school time,
and that was because the headteacher had decided it
would make a nice change for us to get some exercise
and fresh air. The only other school trip we went on
was to a watermill beside another small river. Again, we
went on foot (it was only a couple of kilometres from the
school). We had prepared some questions to ask the
owner, and we actually had a very early form of cassette
recorder with us so that we could pretend we were
carrying out an interview like professional journalists.
Due to the fact that most of us walked to school, severe
weather conditions like snowstorms very rarely resulted
in the closure of the school. On such days, we spent as
much time as we could smoothing the snow to make
shiny slides. We knew we were doing well when the slide
became black ice. On those days, the kids who went
to the high school, which was about twenty kilometres
away, had to stay at home because the bus couldn’t
reach the village. We would often see them during the
breaks because they would come and have snowball
fights with us.



Trip to Central Europe
I was on a cultural tour of Central Europe. One excursion
on our itinerary was a boat trip along the canals that run
through a historic city centre. In theory, I suppose, we
were going to learn something about the city’s beautiful
architecture without doing a lot of walking as we had
on other days. After we’d been sitting in the boat for
some time, I realised that it was rather uncomfortable
with so many people sitting so close together, and we
were so low in the water that we couldn’t see many of
the buildings that we were being told about. The old
man sitting next to me said that he had had more fun
watching paint dry, and I must say I felt the same.



Boat
There were about fifteen of us in each of the small inflatable
rubber boats. Luckily, the captain and crew had managed
to tie them all together so that we didn’t drift apart. We
spent our time nibbling on biscuits and sipping from our
water bottles. Sometimes we sang songs or told each
other stories. Fortunately, it wasn’t a very cold or windy day.
However, we were very uncomfortable until the coastguard
boat arrived after about eight or nine hours. We were lucky
that the captain had been able to contact them before our
plane had sunk to the ocean floor.



Our boat
Our boat was exactly the same as any standard 19th
century wooden lifeboat, but we weren’t at sea. We were
tied to our seats wearing virtual reality headphones and
goggles. The boat bounced about and got hit by some
very heavy waves that would have soaked us if we hadn’t
been wearing our waterproofs. The wind was strong and
the thunder and lightning seemed very realistic. Even
more realistic were the screams from some of my fellow
passengers sharing this historical experience. 



Summer Holiday
Every summer holiday, I loved to go fishing on that vast
lake with my grandpa and uncle. They had a wooden boat
that they rowed out into the middle of the lake using the
two long oars. There was also a little outboard motor, but
I think it was only for emergencies. I certainly never saw
them using it. On one particular day, however, we started
moving forward without any effort. We were all really excited
because my uncle had caught such a huge fish that it was
pulling the boat along as it tried to get away from us. It was
such a beautiful fish that my uncle eventually let it go



Weekend
One weekend my friends persuaded me to go out in one
of the boats that were on the beach. They said that the
owners wouldn’t mind. There was no engine, just two oars
and a couple of buckets. It was rather a heavy boat, so it
took us quite some time to pull it down to the sea and into
the water. After we’d been rowing for just a short time, I
realised why the buckets were there. The sea was coming
in through some small holes. Two of us had to empty the
boat as fast as we could with the buckets, while the third
rowed as quickly as possible back to the beach. Looking
back, it seems really funny, but we were too exhausted to
laugh at the time.




Interview
I: In the studio today, we have retired judge, Jessie
Jolly, who, at the age of 70, has enrolled as a fulltime university student. It’s good to have you with us,
Jessie. Why did you decide to go back to university?
W: You might think that I’ve already been a pensioner
for a few years, but a lot of my colleagues don’t retire
until they’re 72. However, much as I enjoyed my work,
I want to experience and enjoy more in life, and being
a student is a very positive change for me
I: What can you tell us about the subjects that you’ve
chosen to study?
W: There’s almost no limit to the variety of subjects you
can do, but I’m concentrating on three. They are all
things that I’ve been interested in learning more about
for quite some time, although I’ve never studied them
properly before. The first subject is philosophy. It’ll be
interesting to find out what the world’s greatest thinkers
believe. The second is psychology. I’ve met all sorts of
people over the years, and I’m fascinated by the ways
in which different people’s minds work. My other choice
is literature. The great writers can enlighten us about the
problems and dilemmas that people face, and focus on
issues that may affect all of us in one way or another.
I: How does it feel to be the oldest student in your
classes?
W: I had some concerns about that, but I soon got
over them. For a start, there are quite a few
middle-aged students. But most importantly, I’ve
been warmly welcomed as an equal by students
of all ages, not to mention our tutors. In some
respects, they have greater expectations of me
because of my age and experience, but this only
helps me feel more welcome and appreciated.
I: And how do you find the intellectual challenges of
university?
W: Actually, I don’t think that it’s any tougher for me.
Obviously, my mind isn’t as fresh and agile as it
once was. It takes me longer to learn new facts.
However, through my work, I’ve had to develop good
reading skills that can help me pinpoint the most
important details and prioritise the points in whatever
I read. Also, I’ve certainly experienced a lot over the
years, and this has helped me to understand the
background to certain situations that may not be so
obvious to younger students. I can’t say it’s easy, but
I’m certainly interested in the challenges I face, and I
love the opportunities I have to explore different topics
through other people’s opinions.
I: What about classwork and exams?
W: Well, I get great feedback from my tutors, who go
out of their way to emphasise positive points about
my work. That doesn’t mean to say that they don’t
address my weaknesses, but they manage to help
me recognise them in such a way that it appears to
be my own discovery. As for exams, my first ones
will be in a few weeks, and although you can never
know in advance, I think that I’ll write answers that
I can be proud of.
I: Of course, social life is a very important part of
university. How do you fit in there?
W: In that regard, I’ve settled in quite nicely, thank
you. I’m an active member of the debating society,
which keeps my mind working and gives me a
clear picture of just how passionate young people
are about the difficult issues facing our world. Also,
although I can’t call myself an athlete, I’m having a wonderful time keeping fit at the T’ai Chi club. The
cookery club is a great social group for me, too. The
best chefs seem to be chemistry students.
I: And after you get your degree, what do you see
yourself doing?
W: Well, I’m in no hurry to get to graduation day. I
plan to enjoy every single moment of my journey
there. But, if everything goes according to plan, I’m
considering going for a postgraduate qualification.
Throughout my life I’ve played my part in society
and I’ve certainly benefited from it in many ways. If I
can, I’d like to make my own contribution, probably
in the field of law, by carrying out research that will
improve people’s lives in one way or another.
I: Thank you very much, Jessie, for an interesting
chat, and good luck with your studies



Young Mother
Lisa Tyler was weary after a long, hard day at the pottery factory where she works. But as she
approached her home in the English city of Stoke-on-Trent, her heart lightened.; soon she
would be having a nice cup of tea, putting her feet up and watching Friends, her favourite TV
series. But first, she needed to change out of her work clothes and pick up her three-year-old
son from his grandmother‟s house nearby.
As Lisa walked up her garden path, she noticed a light flashing on and off in an upstairs bedroom. A
shiver went down her back. What if it was a burglar? Quietly, she crept round to the back of the house to
see if there was any sign of a break-in. Sure enough, a window was open and someone‟s coat was
hanging on the gatepost!
Well, 26-year-old Lisa didn‟t fancy coming face to face with a burglar, so she ran to a neighbour‟s house
and rang the police. But as she sat waiting for the police to arrive, Lisa‟s curiosity got the better of her
and she decided to go back and see what was going on. That‟s when she saw a leg coming out of the
downstairs front window. It was a man climbing out. Lisa gasped in shock. The burglar was carrying her
portable television!
At this point, Lisa saw red. She didn‟t have many possessions and she‟d saved long and hard to buy
that set. Besides, nobody was going to stop her watching Friends.
„Oh, no you don‟t,‟ she muttered under her breath, as the fury swelled inside her. Without even stopping
to think, she tore across the garden and started shouting at the burglar. „Give me my TV - drop it now!‟
she screamed.
Ignoring her, the man fled across the garden. So Lisa threw herself at him and successfully rugbytackled him to the ground. The burglar struggled to escape, but Lisa hung on like the best kind of guard
dog despite being punched and kicked. As she looked up, she realised that she recognised the burglar‟s
face. She was so surprised that she lost her grip and burglar got away, leaving the TV behind in the
garden.
By the time the police and her father arrived, Lisa was in tears. ‟I can‟t believe you were so foolish, Lisa,'
scolded her father. „You could have been killed.‟
„I know, but at least he didn‟t get my TV,‟ she replied.
Lisa later remembered the name of the burglar, who had been in the same year as her at school. He was
later caught and jailed for 15 months after admitting burglary and assault. In May last year, Lisa was
given a Certificate of Appreciation by Staffordshire Police, for her „outstanding courage and public
action‟. But in the future she intends to leave household security to a new member of her family, Chan,
who is real guard dog. 



Matthew Wreng
I live in what’s called a hall of residence where I
get full board as well as a room. It’s not exactly
what you call cheap, though, I pay £87 per week
for my single room and three meals a day. This
also includes the use of a washing machine and
ironing board. But I can’t complain because my
room has just been re-carpeted, the furniture’s
new and the cleaner comes in daily. The main
drawback is sharing the bathroom with nine other
students and we don’t have any kitchen facilities.
The first thing I did when I arrived was buy
myself a mini-fridge, so I could have cool drinks
whenever I wanted. But, we’re on the university
network, so I have access to the Internet and free
e-mail from my room, and we get room phones
so I can ring friends around the campus for
nothing



Kerry Dunnock
The city where I study is appalling for cheap
accommodation, and the college has nothing of
its own to offer you, but I was lucky, I found a
room in a nice little terraced house with central
heating which I share with three other girls. I
have a yearly contract with a private landlady
and I pay £220 a month for my study bedroom.
This is not bad as it also has a large walk-in
wardrobe where I put all my stuff. I share the
bathroom, kitchen and a small living room with
the other girls, and we split all the bills between
us. We tried to make a rota for the washing up,
cleaning and putting out the rubbish, but it’s not
always strictly followed. Cooking your own food
is much cheaper than eating at college, and I like
it because I have what I want when I want it.



Becky Martin
I live in a college-owned self-catering block. There’s
not much luxury, but I get value for money. For my
£38 per week rent, I get a reasonably-sized room with
an old wardrobe, a tiny desk, one shelf, a rather
stained carpet and a sink. When I first moved in, I
probably spent more on decoration than I did on
food. My only real complaint, though, was that I had
to buy a new pillow because the one I was provided
with felt like a plastic bag full of old towels. I share
the kitchen and bathroom with six other girls. One of
them has a TV in her room, but she is a bit possessive
about it. The fridge is not huge, so you’re always
trying to squeeze your food into the last remaining
inch of space. I twice set off the fire alarm by
burning my dinner, so tended to give up on cooking
after that. We eat a lot of take-aways. In the next
block there’s a games room where we hang out
which has things like table football and satellite TV
if you need a break from studying.



Karl Yorat
I made the big mistake of going to a college fairly
near my home. It isn’t so much the course that I
don’t like, but the fact that I’m stuck at my parents’
house so I don’t feel in touch with what’s going on
at campus. In some ways I’m lucky because I’m not
paying out all the money for food and rent that other
people have to find, and I have someone to do my
washing, but I don’t have the same amount of
freedom or privacy as the people who’re living away
from home. I even have to share a room with my
younger brother. When I told my parents I wanted to
move out and go into college accommodation, they
said they’d stop supporting me financially. So, in
the end, I had to give up the idea, that hasn’t made
any of us very happy.




Rising Star
It’s my first time driving to Chelsea’s training ground and I turn off slightly too early at the London University playing fields. Had he accepted football’s rejections in his early teenage years, it is exactly the sort of ground Duncan Williams would have found himself running around on at weekends. At his current age of 18, he would have been a bright first-year undergraduate mixing his academic studies with a bit of football, rugby and cricket, given his early talent in all these sports. However, Duncan undoubtedly took the right path. Instead of studying, he is sitting with his father Gavin in one of the interview rooms at Chelsea’s training base reflecting on Saturday’s match against Manchester City. Such has been his rise to fame that it is with some disbelief that you listen to him describing how his career was nearly all over before it began
Gavin, himself a fine footballer – a member of the national team in his time – and now a professional coach, sent Duncan to three professional clubs as a 14 year-old, but all three turned him down. ‘I worked with him a lot when he was around 12, and it was clear he had fantastic technique and skill. But then the other boys shot up in height and he didn’t. But I was still upset and surprised that no team seemed to want him, that they couldn’t see what he might develop into in time. When Chelsea accepted him as a junior, it was made clear to him that this was more of a last chance than a new beginning. They told him he had a lot of hard work to do and wasn’t part of their plans. Fortunately, that summer he just grew and grew, and got much stronger as well.’ 
Duncan takes up the story: ‘The first half of that season I played in the youth team. I got lucky – the first-team manager came to watch us play QPR, and though we lost 3-1, I had a really good game. I moved up to the first team after that performance.’ Gavin points out that it can be beneficial to be smaller and weaker when you are developing – it forces you to learn how to keep the ball better, how to use ‘quick feet’ to get out of tight spaces. ‘A couple of years ago, Duncan would run past an opponent as if he wasn’t there but then the other guy would close in on him. I used to say to him, “Look, if you can do that now, imagine what you’ll be like when you’re 17, 18 and you’re big and quick and they won’t be able to get near you.” If you’re a smaller player, you have to use your brain a lot more.
Not every kid gets advice from an ex-England player over dinner, nor their own private training sessions. Now Duncan is following in Gavin’s footsteps. He has joined a national scheme where people like him give advice to ambitious young teenagers who are hoping to become professionals. He is an old head on young shoulders. Yet he’s also like a young kid in his enthusiasm. And fame has clearly not gone to his head; it would be hard to meet a more likeable, humble young man. So will he get to play for the national team? ‘One day I’d love to, but when that is, is for somebody else to decide.’ The way he is playing, that won’t be long.



Kombat Kate
James Stanton meets ‘Kombat Kate’ Waters, who trains theatre actors in how to ‘fight’ on stage.
There must be few occasions when it would be really rude to refuse an invitation to head-butt someone
you’ve just met! But I’m in one of those right now. I’m in a rehearsal room in a theatre with a group of
actors, facing up to stage fighting director Kate Waters. I’ve already dragged her around the room and
slapped her on the arm. Now she wants me to head-butt her. But fear not, this is all strictly pretend!
‘Imagine there’s a tin can on my shoulder,’ she says. ‘Now try to knock it off.’ I lower my head as instructed,
then lift it sharply, aiming for the imaginary can, hoping desperately that I don’t miscalculate the angle and
end up doing damage to her face. To my amazement, I get it right. ‘That was good,’ says Waters. ‘Now
maybe try it again without smiling.’
Waters, known in the industry as Kombat Kate, is showing me how actors fight each other without getting
hurt, and that includes sword-fighting. (She inspires fierce devotion: when I tweet that I’m meeting Waters,
one actress friend responds: ‘She’s amazing. She taught me how to be a secret service agent in two days.’)
Perhaps the most famous play Kate has worked on recently was called Noises Off. She taught the cast how to
fall down stairs without breaking any bones. One of the fight scenes is fairly close, Kate tells me, to the one
we’re trying out now. ‘I’ve just slowed it down a bit,’ she says tactfully, before inviting me to throw her
against the wall. I obey, making sure I let go of her quickly, so she can control her own movement. Push your
opponent too hard, and they will hit the wall for real. I watch her hit the wall before falling to the ground.
She’s fine, of course. ‘That’s my party trick,’ she says with a grin. ‘Works every time.’
Once the lesson is over Kate tells me how she became one of only two women on the official register of stage
fight directors. Already a keen martial arts expert from childhood, Kate did drama at university, and one
module of her course introduced her to stage combat. When she made enquiries about the possibility of
teaching it as a career, she was told about the register and the qualifications she’d need to be accepted onto it.
It was no small order: as well as a certificate in advanced stage combat, she would need a black belt in karate
and proficiency in fencing, a sport she’d never tried before.
But she rose to the challenge and taught the subject for several years at a drama college before going
freelance and becoming a fight advisor for the theatrical world. The play she’s working on is Shakespeare’s
Richard III. This involves a famous sword fight. With no instructions left by the great playwright other than –
Enter Richard and Richmond: they fight, Richard dies – the style and sequence of the fight is down to Kate
and the actors.
‘I try to get as much information as possible about what a fight would have been like in a particular period,’
Kate explains. ‘But because what I’m eventually doing is telling a dramatic story, not all of it is useful. The
scene has to be exciting and do something for the audience.’
Ultimately, of course, a stage fight is all smoke and mirrors. In our lesson, Kate shows me how an actor will
stand with his or her back to the audience ahead of a choreographed slap or punch. When the slap comes it
makes contact not with skin but with air: the actor whacks his chest or leg to make the sound of the slap.
In the rehearsal room, I can’t resist asking Kate how she thinks she would fare in a real fight. Would she give
her attacker a hard time? She laughs, ‘Oh, I’d be awful,’ she says. ‘I only know how to fake it.’ I can’t help
thinking, however, that she’s just being rather modest.



Walking on waves
My journey to the sea began when I was tiny.
My mum, who used to surf then, would sit me
on one of her old boards and push me into the
little waves in a few centimetres of water. We
both soon realised I had an unstoppable
appetite for the waves, something which has
never faded. Soon after that we moved to a
house which was almost on the beach. I could
literally walk out of the garden into the sea.
Living by the sea is something you never take
for granted if you surf. I open the curtains in the
morning and my heart leaps as I see the long
perfect lines of waves rolling into the bay
Being the only girl in the water when I was
learning to surf never bothered me because I’d
always been trying to keep up with an elder
brother who was exceptionally good at sports.
So there I was, a tiny little thing, itching to
better my surfing by checking out other surfers
and looking for new moves. I was surfing four
times a day in the summer holidays, before and
after school right through the winter months as
the temperatures dropped and the sea was
really wild. I just couldn’t get enough of it. 
Things started to get competitive as I got older
and stronger. I was tackling more challenging
waves: faster, more powerful and more
dangerous, but I was gaining confidence and
building up my experience, and it was really
rewarding to see myself improving. And that’s
when the boys started to notice me, and they
weren’t too sure how to cope with it. They
seemed to think along the lines of ‘She’s only a
girl – she won’t manage that wave, so I’ll get in
there and show her how to do it.’ Convincing
them that I could hold my own in the waves
wasn’t going to happen overnight. 
Over time and after a few hair-raising moments,
I made some friends and mutual respect
blossomed between me and the guys who
spent all their time in the waves with me. When
I started pulling off some good moves on my
surfboard and throwing a bit of spray on the
waves, they began giving me a bit of credit, so
that if I was going out when the surf was really
big, they would shout out instructions to make
sure I had the best chance. They knew I wasn’t
messing about and that I was going for it out
there. Things got really interesting when I went
in for competitions. In fact, I entered every
national surfing competition over ten years.
Competition surfing can be extremely
frustrating, since you can never guarantee
waves at a certain time on a certain day, and
there’s vast amounts of hanging around
Now I’ve set up a surf school and I’ve got a
whole new perspective. When you start
teaching something, you have to learn for
yourself again. Everything you’ve been doing
instinctively without really noticing for the last
fifteen years has now got to be passed on, and
it gets surprisingly detailed and tricky in parts.
But it’s been fantastic introducing so many
people to the sport, and it’s even better when
you get to see their big grins when they stand
up for the first time and ride a wave into the
shore. Surfing has taken me all over the world
and now it feels like it’s brought me home
again.



You hear a message on a telephone answering machine.
Oh hi it’s me, John. Sorry to miss you – you must’ve already
left for work. Look, I wondered if you wanted to come away
for the weekend. There’ll be about 10 of us including someone
called Sam Brent who says he was at college with you – and
he remembers that you were brilliant at rock and roll! They’ve
decided it’ll be on October 9, Friday night till Sunday. Anyway,
I’ll put the details in the post. I know you’re busy at the
moment, so don’t feel you have to come, but just let me know
one way or the other when you can. Talk to you soon. Bye.



You hear two people talking about a water-sports centre.
F: So how did you like the new sports centre?
M: Well, there’s a wide choice of things to do … It’s just that
their advertisements said something to suit all the family.
I wish they’d had water games for the under fives. There
was nothing really suitable for them. But you can learn to
windsurf or sail, and you have the freedom to go anywhere
in the lake …
F: Isn’t that a bit dangerous?
M: Not really. Nobody’s allowed in the water without a lifejacket, and a rescue boat is on hand all the time.
F: Sounds great.
M: It was



You hear a professional tennis player talking about her career.
Int: Are you ever annoyed by interviewers?
Star: Well, I’m often asked about the financial side
of things. I don’t mind, but I can honestly say,
for many tournaments, I don’t even know what
the prize money is. I just focus on playing to
my full potential. They must find that answer
disappointing! No, the ones I have a problem with
are those who assume it’s all about partying and gossip. 
I wish they’d ask about the real lifestyle;
practising day in, day out, and getting from
tournament to tournament. I probably do around
a hundred long-haul flights a year. It sounds
exciting, but it wipes you out and actually ruins
your social life!



You hear a poet talking about his work.
I’ve been slowly writing more and more poems for kids over the
last few years. Talking to young people in schools, which I’ve
been doing for some time now, reinforces my belief that they
need and want the same range of subjects that older people do
– relationships, work, family, etc. Often it’s something that only
emerges after my poems are finished, but quite a few of them
in my new collection were first thought of as poems for adults,
until I realised that they might work just as well, or better, for
kids. But I hope it’s a book that adults will enjoy too.



You hear two people talking about a programme they saw on TV.
F: Did you watch that programme about the Gobi Desert last
night? I thought it’d be really interesting because it’s a part
of the world I know very little about.
M: The photography was brilliant, wasn’t it?
F: Yes, you could really feel how harsh the life was there.
M: Overwhelmingly grey, I thought. It’d be hard to feel
cheerful living in that landscape.
F: It was a bit short on facts though, wasn’t it?
M: I don’t think it was that kind of programme. They just
wanted you to be amazed at the fantastic landscape. I
guess that’s why there wasn’t much commentary.
F: You’re right. I hadn’t thought of that.



You hear two people talking about an ice-hockey game they’ve just seen.
M: So your first live ice-hockey game. Glad you came?
F: Well, I wouldn’t have missed it for the world, but it was
so cold – I had no idea that it would be like that. I wish I’d
brought my thicker coat!
M: That’s normal! At least it was a really exciting game – our
team was doing much better than usual.
F: Well, perhaps that accounts for the noise! I knew it would
be loud, but it was incredible.
M: What do you expect? We have to support them!
F: Well I can say I’ve done it – just don’t expect to see me
here next week …!



You overhear two friends talking about a restaurant.
M: I can see why people really rate the place.
F: Yeah. They really know how to bring out the flavours in
the different dishes. They also put a lot of thought into
combining unusual ingredients. And as a restaurant it’s not
too stuffy and formal. It’s got a really lively feel about it.
M: Perhaps a little too lively. It was quite hard to hear each
other above the din. I’m not sure it’d be the place to come
for a romantic dinner. Great food though, and so visually
appealing on the plate.
F: They’ve made a lot of effort with that. It really adds to the
experience, doesn’t it?



You hear a man talking on the radio.
As a result of heavy snow, there has been major disruption to
rail services this morning. A number of breakdowns have been
reported in the west, with people stranded on some trains. In
this region blizzard conditions are making driving conditions
hazardous. A severely restricted train service will be operating
within the next few hours into the capital and delays are
expected on all lines in the south of the country. In the north,
there is some snow, but services have been able to continue,
with only a few cancellations reported.



Spectacled Bear
Thanks for inviting me tonight. As you know, my main interest
is in conservation and I’m lucky enough to work with lots of
different organisations looking after animals both in captivity
and in the wild. I’d been fascinated by all kinds of bears for a
long time before I started working in this field. But it was the
spectacled bear that really attracted me – some people find it
appealing because of its size and shape, and it’s less well known
than other types of bear, but for me I thought it was such a
great name! It comes from the patches of yellowish fur around
the bear’s eyes which grow in a sort of circle shape, like glasses,
although these golden markings vary greatly from one bear to
another and may not be limited to the eyes – they can extend
as far as the bear’s cheeks or even chest.
I’d like to explain what we know about this bear, and why I find
it so fascinating. It’s the only survivor of a type of bear that once
ranged across America during the last Ice Age. We thought that
it was only found in certain places in Venezuela and Chile, but I
was thrilled to read some reports that suggested it might also be
living in northern parts of Argentina and eastern Panama.
It’s quite difficult to find spectacled bears in the wild because they
are quite shy animals, and tend to live in a wide variety of habitats,
which can range from dry coastal deserts to high mountain areas
above 4,000 metres. They are most commonly found in forests,
though. Being such timid animals they tend to come out at night,
which is another thing that makes them difficult to see, though,
like me, you may be surprised to learn that they don’t sleep all
through the winter as many other types of bear do.
We’re not sure about the actual number of spectacled bears that
remain in the wild, but it’s been estimated that there are only
about 2,400 still around. The bears are endangered not so much
because they are hunted by other animals, but what I find really
sad is the fact that humans destroy their habitat. Spectacled
bears are quite small compared with other bears, and of course
they do have other enemies – these mostly include mountain
lions and jaguars – but they remain a smaller threat.
The bears are primarily vegetarian, and their normal diet is tree
bark and berries. On rare occasions though they eat honey,
which I thought was just something in children’s books. I was
interested to find that they are incredibly good climbers, and
one thing I found really funny is that they’ve been known to sit
up a tree for days – they make a platform – why? – I couldn’t
guess, but they’re waiting for fruit to ripen so they can eat it! It’s
quite surprising that although they rarely eat meat they have
extremely strong jaws and wide, flat teeth. Very occasionally
they do eat meat – something like birds or insects though they
like small mice best if they can get them!
We’re really trying to make people more aware of the bears, and
we’ve made a television series about one man’s efforts to make
people understand the dangers facing the animals. He spent a
long time in Peru studying them, and has published a very funny
diary of his time there. I hope everyone will read it, and support
our efforts to help these fascinating creatures!



The city
We spent a day exploring the shops and markets
in the city, and bought some souvenirs. Then
we wanted to see some of the area outside the
city, and discovered it was easy to get to loads of
places by train, including the mountains, where
we were told there were great hostels. You can do
bushwalks out there and apparently the scenery
is stunning. But it can be dangerous – we were
warned to have the right gear and tell other people
where we were going. So we decided to give it a
miss. Anyway, we weren’t short of things to do in
the city! We were spoilt for choice



Vacations
We were pretty tired when we first arrived so we
were glad just to relax. We’d booked late and I
have to say that the room wasn’t the best I’ve
stayed in. But we had a view of the lake, which
was a real treat – we were really impressed by the
forests and mountains around the city. We made
good use of the swimming pool, though we were
too lazy to go to the famous markets. We didn’t
take advantage of all the shows either. Lots of people told us how good they were so that was a
pity. And the theatres themselves were supposed
to be impressive.



The concert
One of my main ambitions was to see inside the
big concert hall – and in fact we managed to get
in to a concert there, which was pretty special.
The acoustics were amazing! The city was divided
by a river, and getting round had its problems,
especially as we didn’t really understand the
city plan. The best way was the ferries – I was
really impressed that they were always on time
and provided good views in the city. The trams
were good too, and the local commuters seemed
happy to chat to us and give us ideas for the best
things to do and see. We didn’t have time to do
everything, though.



Recommendations
Before we went we couldn’t decide where to stay –
so many people recommended different places, and
there seemed to be loads of different and unusual
possibilities, like old traditional farms converted into
guest houses – so we decided to move around and
try something different every couple of nights. That
worked out really well, and they were all excellent.
Although we’d been told that getting round on the
buses was easy and cheap in the city, we decided
to rent a car so that we could get out into the
countryside – we didn’t want to miss out on the
views driving along by the ocean.



City Plan
Even though we had a city plan we got lost several
times – especially in the old town where the
buildings were quite similar – though I know some
people say getting lost is the best way to get to
know a city! We were never short of help, though
– some people were even prepared to walk with
us to show us the way. That was something I’ll
always remember! Our hotel was all right without
being spectacular, and it was a long walk in to
the evening shows – we took a taxi most times.
There was loads to do every day, though, and we
certainly weren’t bored.



How is to work in an art gallery?
Int: This evening in our series ‘Careers with a Difference’ our
guest is Rachel Reed who works for a small commercial art
gallery. Rachel welcome.
RR: Hello.
Int: Rachel, what exactly do you do?
RR: Well, there’s two great things about working for a really
small company. Firstly, you get to do a bit of everything.
The other is that you can practically invent your job title.
Mine is marketing manager – although I do a lot of other
things too, it does describe the majority of what I do.
Int: So, tell us about your day.
RR: Well, it all starts with the huge pile of post we get. We
often get artists sending in photographs of their work to
see if we’d be interested in exhibiting it. I learned very early
on how to differentiate between the ‘possibles’ and those
which are unsuitable.
Int: But how do you tell?
RR: It might be the style, or sometimes the subject matter is
just not going to look right in our gallery, but more often
than not, it’s just that they’re not of the required standard.
The ‘possibles’ I pass on to the gallery manager who makes
the final decision.
Int: So you have quite a lot of contact with artists?
RR: Yes. Sometimes I spend nearly all day on the phone and
about fifty percent of the time it’s artists. I send letters
explaining why we can’t show their work – some of them
phone up to argue about it – I find those calls very hard
to deal with. Artists we do exhibit also phone to find out
if we’ve managed to sell anything and, if we have, when
the money will be coming through. I don’t mind those so
much. Most other calls are from clients. We have a new
artist exhibiting here every two to four weeks and before
the show takes place, we send out a catalogue to the
clients on our database.
Int: Obviously the catalogue’s illustrated?
RR: Oh yes, and as soon as the catalogue goes out, we start
getting phone calls because people see something they like
and want to reserve it. Sometimes they even buy things
over the phone. The catalogue also contains a commentary
about the artist, which I have to write and research. I try
to find out what has influenced them, where they learned
to paint, what the subject matter represents, that sort of
thing, but I try to avoid quoting from positive reviews of
their work; it’s not meant to be advertising as such.
Int: So your job is not all administrative?
RR: Compared to a typical office, that side of it’s quite
minimal, that’s why I can cope without an assistant. There
are systems in place to deal with routine jobs. For instance,
I don’t have to send out the catalogues – the company
which prints them also prints the envelopes and posts
them. Another company takes care of the food and drinks
when we have the opening of a new exhibition.
Int: And are you involved in other aspects of the business?
RR: Yes. The company also offers a consultancy service for
large companies that want to display works of art in their
offices. I phone round companies, explain what we do
and, if they’re interested, make an appointment for the
gallery manager to go and see them. It’s interesting, the
companies tend to go much more for modern or abstract
art than people coming to the gallery.
Int: And the best part of the job for you?
RR: The really rewarding thing for me is that you never know
how a day is going to go. Some days it’ll be really quiet,
other days it’s really busy and you don’t know what you’re
going to have to cope with. And there’s the added bonus
of working with really nice people and of course I have
the pleasure of spending my days surrounded by beautiful
works of art, so I can’t complain.
Int: Thank you Rachel, and now we’ll move on to....



You hear a young man talking about his hobby of rock climbing.
It’s not for everyone, but I love the physical aspect. I started
almost by accident – my uncle took me to an indoor climbing
wall and I was hooked. The start of any climb still gives me a real
buzz. I’ve never settled for being less than the best at anything
I’ve tried, and that’s what pushed me to the standard I am now –
which doesn’t mean I don’t think I can still improve! I get a huge
sense of achievement when I finish a particularly demanding
climb, and though other climbers get nervous sometimes, like
when there’s ice, or the weather’s bad, that never puts me off



You hear a public announcement at a family theme park.
Attention everybody. This is Sonia Lee and I’m events manager
for today at Seaworld Centre. If you hurry to Zone D you can
catch the spectacular ‘riding with dolphins’ event. The next one’s
on at 5 past 11, but don’t worry if you miss that, because you’ve
got three more chances to see it today. We’ll now be feeding
the sea lions at 2.15, that’s 45 minutes later than scheduled
according to your programmes. And whatever you do, don’t miss
the ever-popular Penguin Walkabout. That starts in half an hour.
You’ve never seen anything like it! See you there!



You hear two people talking about a course they have attended.
F: I enjoyed that.
M: It was a bit too businessy for me. I know everything’s about
profits these days, but I still think producing books should be
more about creativity than making money.
F: Everything’s going the same way, whether you like it or not.
A friend of mine did a course on book illustration,
and she said the first lecture was about costs.
M: Anyway, this speaker said if we’re going into the
book trade, we should get practice in as many aspects
as possible.
F: I agree with that. They need an editor for the sports page on
the student newspaper, and I think I’ll go for it.



You hear two people talking about a film they have both seen.
F: Well, what did you think of that film?
M: I had mixed reactions really. From what I’d read, I expected it
to be funnier.
F: I know what you mean – just shows how different people’s
tastes can be I guess. Good twist at the end though. I wasn’t
expecting that, were you?
M: I kind of guessed what was coming to be honest. There were
a lot of references to other films in the storyline I thought.
F: Oh, you think so? I wasn’t quite sure what message it was
trying to convey, though. One minute it seemed to be saying
one thing and the next it was saying the opposite.
M: Yeah, I agree



You hear a man being interviewed about a new project he has set up in his home town.
F: Steven, this new environmental project you’re running, what
are you hoping to achieve?
M: Well, Susie, the town I live in, Melbury, is a very pleasant
place to live – clean and tidy. The problem really isn’t
with Melbury as such but is a wider problem – that of the
dangers of rubbish to wildlife. So I got all the retailers in
the town together and showed them a film I’d made on
this subject and as a result they’ve agreed to use paper
bags instead of plastic ones. Recycling was introduced very
successfully last year so I’m hoping that my new project
will have similar success.



 You hear a man talking on the radio about salespeople.
M: Professional salespeople can sell anything to anyone and
they do this by using very basic psychological techniques.
Buyers normally have certain requirements by which they
will judge the suitability of a product. The seller therefore
attempts to find out what these conditions are by building a
bond – asking questions about hobbies, family and the like;
but you need to remember, the seller is only interested in
‘closing the deal’. At its most extreme, salespeople will even
attempt to mirror the body language of the buyer. If the
buyer laughs, then so will the seller. 



You hear two friends talking about a student website.
M: The college website is up again. Have you seen it?
F: Yes, they’ve been working on it for a month and it’s
better now. I thought, if they’d got sponsorship from local
companies, there’d be too many advertisements, but it’s OK.
M: Yeah. That’s not a problem. They must’ve got someone in
from the design department to work on it, because there are
some real improvements, it’s not so dull.
F: Especially the artwork on the home page. They want people
to send in ideas so they can change the layout regularly.
M: OK, so long as it doesn’t get too complicated and you waste
time figuring out how to get to the page you want.
Now listen again.
8: You hear a chef talking about taking part in a cookery
competition.
F: How did you find the competition?
M: Tough, but I really enjoyed it. I was convinced the dishes I’d
chosen to prepare would go down well. I decided to focus
on using local ingredients as people nowadays worry a lot
about what they’re eating and it’s really important to know
where the food comes from. It was my first time competing
against others and it was fun being under pressure to come
up with things under strict time limits. I hadn’t expected to
be so worn out though, I think it was having to be on my feet
for so long, but it’s definitely something I’ll do again.



My experience in Ausatralia
Hello everyone. My name is Chris Graham and I spent my last
vacation working in Australia. The place I was in is a popular tourist
spot so there are lots of student jobs advertised in the newspaper
– from hotel work to being a tour guide. I saw my job, for a bus
driver, on the internet, and so I applied. I’d recommend you do
that too. The whole idea of getting to know another country really
appealed to me and I’m really pleased I had the opportunity to go.
I worked for a company which tries to help tourists understand
what life used to be like before Europeans arrived – a time
before clothes, cars and electricity. Many of the local people, the
Aborigines, work for the company. Studying tourism at university
wasn’t essential to get the job – in fact, my subject’s history.
What I did do was a short training course when I first arrived,
though, to learn about the local plants and animals.
At first, I was given a room in a hotel in town but I found that
I felt quite lonely so I moved into a caravan on the outskirts.
Lots of other staff lived on the site and I got to meet lots of the
local people there too. Everyone was really friendly and, as there
wasn’t a cinema or restaurant nearby, people frequently had a
party on Saturday night and I was always invited.
I worked six days a week, and I had to get up really early in the
morning when most people, and even the birds and animals,
are asleep. This is so the tourists can get to take photos of the
sunrise. I used to pick them up from their hotels around
5.00 a.m. and then head out of town and into the desert.
The tourists were from all over the world and often had no
experience of the heat. They knew, of course, about covering
their head and neck with a hat but often left their shoulders
uncovered, which wasn’t very sensible, especially if they hadn’t
been in the country for long and weren’t used to the sun.
After we had been into the desert, I would take the tourists to
the local cultural centre, where they had the opportunity to ask
questions. The tourists were especially keen to find out how to
distinguish the tracks of kangaroos from wallabies and wild dogs
After the morning session I usually went back home, had
a shower and a rest, then started again around two in the
afternoon. I used to take the afternoon group to a water hole,
where they were shown which plants could be eaten and which
were also used to make weapons for hunting.
At one time, there were very few tourists in the particular area
I worked in, because you needed to get a coach from the small
railway station in the nearest large town, a good 200 kilometres
away. There’s now an airport but the local government is keen to
get one built which can take more flights, especially from abroad.
I’m not sure about that, as I think it’s busy enough as it is, but it
would be good for the local economy, no doubt about it.
Anyway, I really recommend working in Australia during your
vacation. The busy tourist season in the area where I worked is
from May to October, so you need to make sure your application
is in by the January of the year you are hoping to work. You might
not hear until March as it takes a while to process the applications
and get references, but make sure you don’t leave it too late



What is  happiness?
What is happiness? From an early age happiness
for me is sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake
on a summer’s day and doing some serious fishing
… all alone just me and my thoughts. No stress,
get away from it all for an hour or so, but maybe
not completely aimless – not just lying on a beach
somewhere, but having some task to do. Then,
when it’s all over, it’s back to normal life and
problems and hassle, and having to fight to get
what you want. But that brief moment of happiness
helps me to reflect and make sense of my life.



Be happy
I think to be happy, you do obviously need some
financial security – not rich … I didn’t say that, ’cos
there’s an important difference. Also I’d say you
need humour in your life … that’s kind of obvious
too. Having lots of free time to do what you want?
Not sure, there. I’d say quite the reverse, actually.
For me, you really appreciate your moments of
leisure when you’ve done lots of hard work. If it’s all
play and no work in your life, then you don’t enjoy
it. So for me, it’s all to do with … setting yourself
a list of things to get through and then you’ve
completed them. Now you can be happy.



Happiness and age
 I sometimes wonder if being happy is something to
do with age. Very young children are happy most of
the time; very old people are happy when they think
of fond memories, and also they’re happy when
they see their grandchildren happy. So happiness is
not just specific to one age group. That’s certainly
the case with my family. But in my experience
happy people get through life more easily – if you
take things seriously all the time, that’s when you
get stressed or have health issues, maybe. And
sometimes life can be a real pain, let’s be honest.



Happiness comes in many shapes and forms.
Personally I’m happy when I’m active, doing my
sports and feeling all healthy. But maybe that’s a
rather self-centred view. I also get moments when
I’m just, say, sitting on a train, and suddenly I think
of my children’s smiling faces, and realise how lucky
I am, how happy they make me – and my husband
too, of course. My life could’ve turned out much
worse, as it has for many people. Will I still be
happy when they’ve all grown up and gone away?
I’m sure when that time comes, I’ll find a new form
of happiness



Life is beautifull
It’s sometimes said that you make your own
happiness, and I’ve got some sympathy for that
view. But in my experience, it’s something more
than that. It might sound strange, but I honestly
think it’s all about your life not being too easy. If
everything in your life is handed to you on a plate
by rich parents then I actually don’t think you’re as
happy as someone who’s had to struggle a bit in
their life. When you can share your struggles with
others and laugh about how you got through them,
that’s when you’re truly happy. That’s certainly how
it’s worked out for me.



Interview with Mickey Smith
F: Today on the programme we have Mickey Smith, author of
the book The Power of Practice. Mickey, in your book you talk
about what makes a champion sportsperson. Your argument
is that talent – a natural aptitude or skill – doesn’t exist. Right?
M: Right. I know that’s controversial because it’s thought that
people are born with natural abilities. I have my critics but
the evidence from research I’ve done backs up my argument.
If you look at anyone who’s reached a high level in any
complex task, you’ll find they’ve spent many years building
up to it. This has started other people thinking and doing
their own research. I’ve no doubt they’ll reach the same
conclusions I have.
F: What about physical abilities like speed? Isn’t that what
makes one footballer better than another, for example?
M: There are physical issues that are significant in some
activities. However, in virtually all complex tasks the limiting
factor is a mental thing. People don’t become the greatest
footballers because they move around the pitch quickly.
While he may not realise it, the way a great footballer
understands where his teammates are around him on the
field is what helps him score goals, rather than speed.
F: In your book you also talk about geographical areas
where lots of people become experts in the same activity.
Gymnastics, for example.
M: The town I grew up in produced the top gymnasts of my
generation, myself included. My initial reaction when I got
to the top was, ‘Wow’, I must have been born with this
ability to do gymnastics. But what about the others? What I
now understand is that this excellence was down to having
access to a fantastic coach and a 7-day-a-week gymnastics
club, where we transformed ourselves from ordinary to
extraordinary. Opportunity’s another factor determining
success.
F: Your argument is that to become excellent you have to
practise for thousands of hours. That’s a lot of training.
M: That’s right. How successful you are is down to how long
you’re prepared to work. Evidence suggests those who make it
believe excellence relies on practice. If you believe being good
at something is down to natural ability, when you fail, you’ll
think you don’t have enough of it – and you’re more likely to
give up. If you believe excellence is about effort, when you fail
you’re going to see it as an opportunity to grow.
F: What approach should coaches take when training
youngsters in sport?
M: The way to go about it is to ensure the child enjoys what
they’re learning – that it becomes an internal desire to
progress. Coaching young people is more about psychology
than it is about the technical side of things – it’s making
the young performer really care about where they’re going,
motivating them in the right way, that will enable them to
actually get there – little difference from how you encourage
adults really.
F: Why don’t more people who play sport try harder to improve?
M: Well, they see sports stars and assume they were born
brilliant, but there’s no evidence to suggest that. You just
don’t see the painstaking process it took to get them there
when they’re winning games on your TV screen. If you did,
their brilliance wouldn’t seem so miraculous. The illusion is
to think they got there quickly and think ‘Oh my goodness, I
could never get up that slope.’
F: Given everything you’ve said about top performers, why
do they sometimes fail at crucial moments? That’s called
‘choking’, right?
M: Yes. It’s to do with the expectation to succeed, no matter
how many times they’ve done it before. When you first
practise a skill you have to exert conscious control over
it. When you become proficient you’re able to do it
subconsciously. When you choke you become so anxious
that instead of delivering your skill automatically, you
become conscious of what you’re doing and it’s like you’ve
never done it before.
F: Thank you very much [FADE]



Novel
There was a small breeze when Christine came out for her lunch as she usually did,
even when it was raining, instead of going up to the store canteen. You could never get
a table to yourself there, and whoever sat with you always wanted to complain about
the shop, the customers, the management or the canteen food. Everyone at Goldwyn’s
seemed to have a complaint of some kind, although it was one of the best London
stores to work for, and many of the staff had been there for years – some of them were
long past retiring age. This was because the management let them stay on even when
they were really past it, like poor old Martha, who was always trying to sell people
dresses that were much too old for them.
Christine herself had been in the book department for more than four years. She had
started as a junior, knocking over piles of books and breaking the till once a week in her
efforts to serve customers quickly. Now she was Head Salesperson and moved calmly
around the department between the bright new paperbacks, knowing that book
customers liked to take their time, unlike the people who stampeded through the other
parts of the shop with never a moment to spare.
She knew every book in the place, and all about the new ones before they came out.
She was said to be Mr Parker’s right-hand person – and heaven knows he needed one –
and was sometimes asked into his office to meet a favoured publisher’s representative.
The book department, partly due to Mr Parker’s weak administration and partly
because it was thought to be sophisticated, was the only department in Goldwyn’s
where you did not have to wear black. This led to some confusion as to who was an
assistant and who was a customer, not untypical of bookshops, and accounted for the
distressed look of people who picked up a book they wanted but were afraid of having
their elbows grasped by the store detective before they could find someone to take their
money.
Christine was wearing her grey suit today. She liked the grey suit. She had liked it
for a long time, because she had accepted her aunt’s advice that it was better to buy an
expensive suit that would last than to keep buying cheap suits that looked very smart
for a few weeks, until they began to wrinkle at the elbows and sag at the seat. The grey
suit had been what the shop had called a ‘classic’, which meant that nobody would ever
turn round in the street to look at it, but it would stand having its skirt taken up or let
down according to the swings of fashion.
Christine liked her work, as much as one can like any job that imprisons one from
nine till five-thirty. She liked Goldwyn’s, but she was always glad to get away from it
at lunchtime, even though it meant queuing for a table at one of the restaurants and
teashops that fed the local shop-workers. Here people tended to eat with one eye on
their watches and had a taste for things like pasta and puddings which were the most
filling at the least cost. But Christine, once seated, enjoyed a leisurely, if lonely,
sandwich.
Alice, who was her junior, was always meeting people at lunchtime. Even if it was
only a man who had picked up her handkerchief in the cafeteria, she made it sound
exciting, like an adventure. Alice and the other junior, Helen, were always giggling in
the classics section where the customers did not go much. If Christine came along, they
would suddenly look serious and pretend to be straightening books. Christine thought
this should have made her feel very old, but it didn’t. She was so much happier than she
had been at the giggling age. She liked her authority in the book department.
Sometimes, outside, she insecurely wondered how she stood in relation to the rest of
the world. At Goldwyn’s she was someone



Speak easy
We have all sat through somebody
mumbling a series of disconnected
thoughts and wondered when it was
going to end. It is important to
remember how you felt for the person
doing the talk. Most probably, you
sympathised with them and were
relieved for them when they had ‘got
through it’. This is important because
your audience will also want the best
for you. Visualise yourself delivering a
witty, clever and informative
presentation with the audience
hanging on every word.
 ‘Nobody plans to fail, they simply fail
to plan.’ Nowhere is this truer than in
the arena of public speaking. The
classic format for any talk has a
beginning, a middle and an end. Think
about how long you want the talk to
last and plan the content of the talk to
fit the right amount of time. Also, think
about your audience: make sure your
approach to the subject of your talk is
neither too complex nor too simple for
them. If you are going to use prompts,
small cards are quite good as they can
be discreet and relatively unnoticeable
compared to large sheets of paper.
 Wherever possible, make sure you
know the venue of your talk and check
that people can see you and any
slides or diagrams you might be using
to support your points. When talking to
a large group, try to keep very close to
the front row as this creates a feeling
of togetherness. Some of the best
comedians use this closeness to
encourage a feeling of secrecy, telling
you things as a stage whisper in order
to build this intimacy.
 It is important that you stand
comfortably with both feet rooted to
the floor but slightly apart. Without
realising it, there will be a tendency to
‘retreat’ from the audience or you may
sway from side to side. Therefore,
think of ways to counteract this when
rehearsing (e.g. imagine you are
wearing heavy lead shoes on your feet
which are keeping your heels down).
Try not to lean on tables or get your
arms too close to your body as you will
restrict your lungs and impair your
ability to project your voice. Although it
may help you feel more relaxed, try
not to walk about when delivering your
speech as this will be distracting for
your audience.
 As with any skill, practice is vital. The
more you practise, the more confident
you will be. Try not to simply read out
what you have prepared, and picture
yourself talking confidently and
knowledgeably about your subject.
After you have been presenting to the
mirror for a while, you will begin to see
which gestures and facial movements
work and which ones look wrong.
Remember that nobody wants you to
do badly and try to feel positive that
you are going to deliver an interesting
and informative talk.
 Despite the fact that we all feel shy or
nervous about talking to a large group,
the reality in a lot of cases is that, once
we get talking and feeling confident,
we all have the ability to ‘perform’. But
remember to talk in a controlled
manner, as we all have a tendency to
rush once we are in front of a big
crowd. Also, if you are going to be
using a microphone, then practise with
it first. If not, make sure that your voice
can fill the room for the time you are
speaking or reduce the time that you
are going to talk. Breathing exercises
and voice projection techniques will all
help.



Dear John,
How are you? I hope everything is going well with you. Do you
remember when you phoned me last time, you told me you needed a job for
this summer. I’ve seen a advertisement in today’s newspaper which is about
an International summer camp and it’s about for 8 to 12 year old children
that I joined last year.
I know at the beginning of that you can think it’s not convinient for
you, but don’t make your decision without hearing about it and what it’ looks
like. Let me tell you about this job.
First of all it’s located in beautiful place in amongs trees, just think
that wonderful nature, brillant wheather and sunshine. It’s stunning place. I
had a great time in that camp last summer. We had a lot of fun during
working hours. Especially outdoor activities, entertaintment, sports
competitions and children’s game are perfect, great and fascinating. We are
staying in tents during summer. Have you ever tried it before? It’s really
different from our houses We have also enough free time for us to go
swimming, fishing, walking on paths and doing nature sports. We are not
working at wekends. I can say that foods are not wonderful but We can go to
town or we can cook our foods in camp kitchen what we want.
At a result of that if you decide to do this job, please let me know as
soon as possible. Because we have short time for applying this job.
I’m looking forward to hearing from you soon
My best wishes,



Dear Jan,
I have already told you about the job I did last summer in the International
Camp for children, do you remember? And this year they are looking for people
for the same job so I have thought about you. Why don’t we do it together?
You will work with children between 8 and 12 and will help with the
organisation of games, sports competitions and outdoor activities. The camp
is situated in a wood, close to a river. It is such a beautiful place! Everybody
sleeps in tents, it is very exciting. And when the children are sleeping, we have
the whole night free to go out and have fun with the staff.
It is a good balance between work and entertainment. We have only 5 hours’
work a day so it gives us enough free time to visit the area and do some
sport activities on our own.
As well as the accommodation, the food is free. It is not wonderful, but it is
not the most important. The contact with children, the feeling of freedom, the
sense of responsibility and the life in the nature make from this camp an
unforgivable experience.
Let me know as soon as possible if you are interested in it, but don’t hesitate
too much, it is worth!
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon
Love,



History expert
Next today we catch up with the five teenagers who we
have been interviewing regularly over the last few years
since they were thirteen, one from each continent. Today
we continue their fascinating life-stories. Listen to their
views to get a really up-to-date account of what life is like
for a teenager in the five different corners of our planet.
Don’t miss it – this week they are answering a variety of
questions which have been sent in by you, the listeners.




Ancient city of York
Every day throughout the summer commencing the 3rd
Saturday in May until the 30th of September, local people
who know something about the origins and development
of the ancient city of York have volunteered to show
visitors around the city and tell them about the old
buildings, historic sites and the people who lived here. For
people interested in the traditional dances of the ancient
inhabitants of this area, there will be a special slide show
at the end of each day.



Looking for a person to...
I wanted people to eat outside and so originally we had a
canvas roof which you could roll back depending on the
weather. It would flap about a bit in the wind, but gave
good protection from the midday sun. But what tended to
happen was that, after a heavy shower, this roof would fill
with water, which at a certain point, given a gust of wind,
would turn back on itself and empty its contents,
splashing the diners beneath. So my son, before he left,
built us this straw roof, but as there are no walls, we still
get just enough sun and breeze.



MAN: How do you like it now you’re head of department?
WOMAN: Fine, I really want to make some changes though.
Lots of parents just can’t afford to keep buying new books
you know for their children. They’re just too expensive –
we really need to bring the price down. The schools can’t
afford them either so there are all these lovely new books
and they’re just sitting in stock rooms not being sold.
The booksellers do their best to promote them but they do
keep telling us the price needs to be more competitive. It’s
time we took some notice because we’re losing money and
nobody is benefiting, least of all the children.



Slimming diet
My friend’s been doing the cabbage soup diet, you know
where you eat almost nothing except cabbage soup for a
week as a way of losing weight. Well, whilst it won’t do her
any harm, there’s no scientific basis for it at all. They’ve
made up rules which are quite hard to stick to and so you
feel that you’re doing something beneficial, which in a way
you are. But, actually if she loses weight, it’ll be because
she’s controlling what she eats – like all such diets, you
know, it will be because she eats less rather than because
of the cabbage itself.




A women talking on the phone
… when it rained, water came straight through the roof
and into the bedroom. The bed’s completely ruined. I’ll
have to buy another one – and new bed clothes. I’m sure
the shop won’t be able to replace it exactly. They never
have what I want in stock. It would never have happened if
your employee hadn’t left a hole. And where am I going to
spend the night? I can’t sleep there...




Work with vegetables
We supply over 400 of London’s restaurants. The vegetables
come from our stores deep in the heart of the wholesale
market where in the very early hours of the morning, the
orders are packed and loaded onto vans for delivery later
that day. Our work begins as the restaurants are shutting.
The chefs have finished cooking and they’re planning the
next day’s menu which means placing their orders for fruit
and veg with us. It gets really tough in the run up to
midnight when everyone phones us at once with their
requests. We don’t catch up on paperwork until the
afternoon – if we’re lucky!



Conversation
WOMAN: I told her she could have it because we were planning
to buy a new carpet pretty soon.
MAN: What did you say exactly?
WOMAN: Well … something like … you know … we’ve got this
old carpet – it’s still in reasonable condition so maybe
you’d like to have it as we’re planning to replace it …
something like that. I know she hasn’t got much money
but to just turn up like that and say ‘OK I’ll take it now.’
She could have waited.
MAN: … I guess you did offer …
WOMAN: I know but … 




Visiting a wildlife park 
PRESENTER: Welcome to Burton Safari Park. This cassette has
been made so that you can listen to a guided tour as you
drive round the wildlife park in your car. Burton is one of
Europe’s oldest wildlife parks. Here you can see wild
animals from all over the world – and they’re not in cages.
Before we start, we do have some information for the
animals’ safety and for your own. First, please stay in your
car at all times. In case of emergency or breakdown, please
use your horn and lights and a ranger will come and help
you. If you’d like to stop, please do so on the left side of the road, allowing traffic to pass on the right. 
Please do not feed the animals. Our animals are fed on special diets and
your leftover picnic might make them ill or even kill them.
We’re starting our tour with some of Burton’s most
interesting wild animals, our four white rhinos from South
Africa. The white rhino doesn’t get its name from its
colour. The African word white means wide and the white
rhino has a wide mouth which helps it eat grasses. Sadly
there aren’t many rhinos left in the world today. Poachers
hunt rhinos for their horns which can be made into things
like handles for knives.
Burton’s oldest animals are two female rhinos, Maggot
and Mary. They’ve been here since the park opened thirty
years ago. They’re great friends and could live to be forty.
Head keeper, Anne Stewart, has worked with rhinos and
other large animals at Burton for twenty years.
ANNE: Rhinos can be dangerous – er – these ones here have
been here a long time so they know me and I know them.
Their hearing’s excellent but their eyesight is poor so it’s
important that I talk and then they recognise my voice and
they’re OK with me.
PRESENTER: Anne has noticed how intelligent the rhinos are.
They can tell the vet’s Volvo car from any other Volvo and
become suspicious if a car is not going round the normal
route.
ANNE: One of the keepers has a special but dangerous job:
checking the rhinos’ toes. There are three toes on each
foot, and they have to be checked regularly in case they get
damaged. There are two male rhinos, Harold and Arthur,
who came to Burton from the north of England. Harold in
particular can get quite angry at times. Their keeper says
sometimes rhinos might want to have a little rub on the
side of your car. It’s because it’s a convenient place to
scratch themselves, but it’s nothing to worry about really.
Just drive out of the way and keep clear of them if they
look as though they are going to use your car in this way. If
you can’t move, sound the horn and someone will come
and rescue you.
PRESENTER: White rhinos spend most of their time eating when
they’re not sleeping or taking a mud bath. The rhinos’ diet
is mostly grass and sugar. The keepers make a special
mixture for them which they seem to enjoy very much.
They have a good life really! And now let’s move on to …

Advices for a good interview
When the company invites you to attend an interview, it
means that the company is interested in you, because
they’ve looked at all the information you’ve given them
about yourself, and they probably think you’ve got a
number of strong points … so now it’s your turn to show
an interest in them … So, if the organisation is … say a car
manufacturer, you need to ask yourself what kind of cars it
makes, how they differ from the rest … Read the
newspapers for details about their expansion plans, new
products and developments. And keep a record of all the
important points.
Well, employers are, of course, looking for ability, for useful
skills … Think carefully of every corner of your daily life for
examples of initiative, teamwork, verbal and written
communication skills. Remember, for example, when you
organised an event at school. Employers want people who
get things done, so it’s useful to note these down and keep
them handy. What I mean is, don’t concentrate on the
things you feel you’re not so good at. If, say, your computer
skills are not top of the range, chances are the job will be
offered to you anyway, on condition that you do some
training to upgrade those skills … 
You’ll have to answer a lot of questions. Interviewers
almost always want to know why! Why you did that
course. Why you decided not to go to university next year.
What kind of leisure activities you like and why. You’ll
have no trouble answering such questions. Now, it’s
advisable to be realistic when it comes to talking about
your problem areas, maybe skills you haven’t quite mastered. Your family and friends may tell you not to
worry, but the truth is you need to be able to show what
action you are taking to reach the standard the company
requires. You need to be prepared for that.
Before you applied for this job, you probably thought
carefully what the company could offer you, and what you
could give them. Spending long hours reading all their
literature won’t help you because you may still be
unprepared for a question they’re likely to ask – what
made you choose them? It is worthwhile remembering
that, say the company is an airline, you are not applying so
as to have worldwide travel opportunities, although of
course you can express your interest in the travel industry.
You need to know what to say, so give it some thought in
advance.
When you’re asked questions, try to avoid giving one-word
answers. It’s easy to do this when you’re a bit nervous.
When asked about leisure interests, for example,
responses such as ‘reading’ or ‘sport’, tell them very little
about you, while ‘I’m a member of a rugby club’, ‘I’m a
drummer in a band’, say much more. This also shows more
enthusiasm, and the people interviewing you may
conclude that you are really very interested in getting this
job. It’s a good idea to think of what to say and practise
your answers with a friend, so you can show off all your
skills on the day.



Interview with Colin Browne
INTERVIEWER: The Youth Hostel Association started in the
1930s and since then the organisation has continued to
provide low-cost accommodation for millions of people
travelling around. I asked Colin Browne, a representative of
the YHA for an update on the hostel situation …
(change of acoustic )
Colin, first of all, is it true that the hostels aren’t as good as
they used to be?
COLIN: Well, if you’re asking me about quality, I’d say – and
most would agree with me – that the opposite is the case.
The original hostels were pretty tough places to stay in …
no hot water … hard floors and beds.
INTERVIEWER: (Mmmmm laughs) But people argue that hostel
travellers don’t want fluffy carpets and matching curtains
and that this goes against the original aims of the
organisation.
COLIN: Well, all I can say is that these criticisms have no basis
in fact. We know what we’re doing … we do market
research, we talk to a random selection of people who
regularly stay in hostels … and the results show that that
we’re getting it right.
INTERVIEWER: But if you look back to the 30s and 40s … when
the organisation started, the general philosophy was very
different, wasn’t it?
COLIN: I think the important thing to remember is that we
aren’t in the 1940s any more. Teenagers don’t travel around
on their own as much as they did then because parents no
longer consider it safe. Our hostels are still full but things
have changed … visitors now are often young families with
children, couples on restricted budgets … people who care
about the environment and are pretty ‘green’ …
INTERVIEWER: How has this affected hostel rules and
regulations?
COLIN: Well, we have to market the YHA to be competitive in
the 21st century. Rules have become more flexible to
accommodate the different types of hostel and their
visitors. Sometimes there is no rule about what time you
have to be back at night, for example, but not in all hostels,
and we still have large open-plan dormitories which not
everyone wants … 
INTERVIEWER: So you’ve switched really from just offering
basic, self-service style accommodation to being more of a
service organisation … like a hotel?
COLIN: Yes, and it’s a reflection of what people want. You
should see my postbag! For every member who writes to
say, ‘It’s not like it used to be’, we get a pile of letters saying
‘This is great!’ If we’d stuck to the old ways, there wouldn’t
be a YHA. There’d be a few hostels with a small
membership of ageing hostellers, with no newcomers and
no future.
INTERVIEWER: Colin, can we talk a little about rural hostels …
I know you’ve had to close some of these. How do you
decide when to close a hostel?
COLIN: There are any number of reasons for closing a hostel –
leases run out, buildings become uneconomic, visiting
patterns change. The general policy is to consider closing
hostels which are significantly below standard, particularly
in terms of safety, where the remedial work required
would be very expensive …
INTERVIEWER: It seems odd to be closing them down when I
know a lot of companies in this type of business are doing
just the opposite.
COLIN: Mmmm it’s true. I do get lots of enquiries – more every
year – from people who want to set up a hostel or a chain
of hostels. And I suppose I do wonder sometimes if we
might end up with more hostels than the market can cope
with. Take the island of Skye in Scotland, for example, ten
years ago, there were 20 hostels there, now there are over
500 … (fade)



Conversation about restaurants
MALE: You know we’ve been talking about where to celebrate
Anna’s birthday? Well, I went along to a few restaurants
yesterday and picked up their menus.
FEMALE: Oh, that was a good idea! So which ones did you get?
MALE: Well, I thought these three looked about the best –
Angelina’s, Blaine’s and The Chophouse. I think we should
think about the problem of parking when we make the
decision. Blaine’s does have some spaces set aside for
customers, but it was a nightmare trying to park outside
The Chophouse – double yellow lines everywhere.
Angelina’s is next to the public car park so that was OK.
FEMALE: Um, you’re right. Maybe we should just encourage
everyone to share cars. OK, so let’s look at the menus. I
know some of Anna’s friends don’t eat meat.
MALE: Well, I checked that they all do vegetarian dishes, but I
think Angelina’s looked the most varied. It’s certainly more
imaginative than Blaine’s and The Chophouse, and I think
that would be the place to go to if you wanted something a
bit different. I have to say though that one of my friends at
work was telling me that he had had a brilliant meal in
The Chophouse last month, huge servings, and only £10 a
head. Angelina’s has great food and is more fashionable
with prices to match, but of course, you feel fashionably
hungry when you leave.
FEMALE: I should think they’re trying hard to get back their
customers after all the problems they had last summer –
you remember that piece in the paper about it having a
dirty kitchen?
MALE: Yes, it sounded revolting, but I’m sure it’s OK now – it’s
got a new chef. Blaine’s chef was in the paper the other
day, did you see it? He was doing all the cooking for his
sister’s wedding. Anyway, we should be careful about
choosing a place because of the chef – it’ll probably be his
night off when we go and some junior will be on duty. I
hear Angelina’s chef is hardly ever there.
FEMALE: Oh, look, you can get a 10 per cent discount at Blaine’s
if there are more than 15 of you in a group, and Angelina’s
does a 10 per cent discount and free desserts for parties of
15 or more, which is even better. The Chophouse will
decorate the room for you if you tell them in advance.
MALE: Well, I prefer a discount to a few balloons, especially as
there’ll be at least 20 of us. I had a good look round when I
went for the menus, and I really liked The Chophouse. It’s
just by the river and you have a great view if you ask for a
table by the window.
FEMALE: That’s true, but what about Angelina’s? It says here we
can have drinks in the garden if the weather is fine and
then either eat inside or stay where we are.
MALE: Ugh! Think of all those insects flying around! You’d like
Blaine’s – they have a large extension built of glass and full
of plants – it’s just like being outside. It was closed when I
first went there to get the menu, so I went to The
Chophouse. All the staff were sitting around in jeans and
T-shirts but they certainly seemed to know their job. They
went out of their way to be helpful. The staff at Angelina’s
were a bit suspicious of me wanting to take a menu away.
They were all very well-dressed but I think they could do
with a few lessons in customer relations!
FEMALE: Well, which one is it going to be then? (fade)



A business interview
Presenter: Welcome to today's show. We're very happy to have Anna Oliveira as our guest today. Anna is the creator and founder of HomeworX – spelled with an 'x' we should note – an app which helps teenagers with their homework. Thanks for coming in, Anna.
Anna: Thanks for having me.
Presenter: So, tell us about your app. How does it work?
Anna: Well, teenagers and their parents have numerous challenges when it comes to homework these days. In many families both parents work and don't have much available time to help their kids with their homework. And even if they do have time to help, they may not be able to offer support with the content. What I mean is, they may not know, or at least remember, enough in any given subject to support.
Presenter: You mean they might not be able to remember complex maths or might have never studied certain subjects, such as biology or economics, themselves?
Anna: Exactly. So they might want to support their children with their homework, but have neither the time nor the knowledge to do so.
Presenter: I see. So the app helps solve this problem?
Anna: Yes, and more. The next issue is that tutors can be expensive, and there may be long waiting lists for specialist tutors in the town or region you live in. Our HomeworX app brings students and tutors together online. Students can search a database of pre-approved tutors and sign up for live online support. They don't need to be in the same town or city.
Presenter: That sounds really great.
Anna: It is. And this approach also enables us to offer the tutoring services at lower prices because there's no travelling time involved for the tutor to get to the student's home. And tutors who live in remote areas are happy to get access to more students, and be able to work from home, even at lower rates.
Presenter: This all sounds great. So, how did you come up with the idea?
Anna: Well, as you might guess, I was one of those parents I described earlier. I really wanted to help my son with his homework, but I was either too busy with work or I didn't actually know anything about the subjects he was having difficulty with. Also, we live in an area where there aren't many tutors and the ones that are there are either very expensive or have long waiting lists.
Presenter: Yes. I can understand your predicament. Well, it sounds like a very useful app that is clearly meeting a need. And its popularity obviously speaks for itself.
Anna: Thank you.
Presenter: So, do you have plans for the future?
Anna: We've just secured some funding and hope to expand the range of services we offer using the app.
Presenter: We wish you the best of luck. Thanks again for coming in. That was Anna Oliveira, founder of the tutoring app HomeworX (with an 'x', don't forget!), which is available for both Apple and Android devices. Join us again next week for another business interview. Have a great week, everyone. 



A design presentation
Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this short presentation on our new product design. As you know, we've already redeveloped our 'Adventure' shampoo to make it more modern and appealing. And we've renamed it 'Adventure Tech'. Our market research established the target market as men in the 18–40 age range who like to be outdoors and also like technical gadgets, such as smartwatches, drones and things like that. We needed to create a bottle which appeals to that market.
So, today, I'm happy to unveil our new bottle design. As you can see, it's designed to look like a black metal drinking flask, with some digital features printed on it.
I'd like to talk you through the following three points: the key features, sizing and our timeline for production.
Firstly, you'll notice it has an ergonomic design. That means it fits smoothly into your hand and can be easily opened and squeezed using one hand. And, it looks like a flask you might use when hiking outdoors. The imitation digital displays are designed to remind the user of other tech devices they may have, such as a smartwatch or smart displays in their home.
I'd now like to tell you about the sizes. It comes in two sizes: the regular size and a small travel size. The travel size is the same type of design – a flask, also with imitation digital displays on the bottle. We were thinking of starting with one and following with the travel-size in a few months, but we've worked hard and both are ready now.
Finally, I'm going to talk to you about our timeline for production. You've probably heard that we're launching in two months. In preparation for that, we're starting the marketing campaign next month. You can see the complete overview of all phases in this Gantt chart.
In summary, the bottle's been designed for men who like adventure and technology, and it comes in two sizes. The marketing campaign is starting next month and we're launching the product in two months.
OK. So, any questions? Feel free to also email me for further information in case we run out of time.



A digital detox podcast
Presenter: So, we're back in the studio. Welcome back, everyone. My name's Rick Walker. From our laptops to our televisions, from the displays on our smartphones to those on our satnavs, we are in front of screens all the time. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to disconnect completely? To choose not to have access to the internet? If you have, you may be in need of a digital detox – a total switch-off from all things digital. The idea of people taking a digital detox is becoming more and more popular, especially amongst young people – and today we're joined by someone who's tried a number of digital detox activities and is here to give us some advice about it. Amanda Vince, welcome to the studio.
Amanda: Thank you very much.
Presenter: So, Amanda, you work for a fashion magazine in London, right? I guess your work means you need to be online a lot.
Amanda: Oh, yes. Apart from the hundreds of emails I get every day, I'm always browsing fashion websites, as well as online videos. I also need to be very active online, especially on Twitter and Instagram – sharing what we're doing in the magazine, interacting with designers, photographers, influencers … it never stops, literally. Then of course there's my friends and family to keep in touch with online too, and for me, my work grew out of my passion, so friends and work colleagues aren't two totally separate groups of people and it all gets a bit messy online sometimes. I think I'm online for at least 12 hours a day.
Presenter: So, how did you get the idea for a digital detox?
Amanda: I read a book about it, called Log Off: How to Stay Connected after Disconnecting. The author's name is Blake Snow. That book gave me some really good advice and made me think about trying to change some of my digital habits. I started with removing distraction.
Presenter: What do you mean by that?
Amanda: That means turning off alerts, buzzes, alarms or notifications of any kind. I had notifications set up for everything, and it meant I was always being forced to look at my phone. Removing all of them except for important contacts helped me focus immediately. The book also made a really good point, that we should ask ourselves 'Why?' every time we take out our phone. I realised that most of the times I looked at my phone were because I was trying to avoid or ignore something else happening right in front of me. It was an automatic habit.
Presenter: I have to confess, that happens to me too. But what else are you going to do when you're standing in line at the bank or waiting for your train?
Amanda: OK, yes, I'm the first to admit that it's great for helping time go by. But speaking personally, I found I wasn't just checking my phone to kill time when I was alone. I was also doing it with friends or family around.
Presenter: Hmmm … right. Well, so far, this doesn't sound too drastic. Turning off notifications and becoming aware of when we use our devices. That sounds easy.
Amanda: Yes, it's the first step. Once we begin to realise just how much of a grip our devices have on us, then we're ready to really take the next step. First, my partner and I did a weekend with absolutely no screens. She found it easier than I did. For me, it was a little bit scary at first but it turned out to be a pretty rewarding experience.
Presenter: A whole weekend, huh? I don't know if I could ...
Amanda: I think everyone has to do this at their own pace. If a weekend feels too much, maybe just try for an evening. Then work your way up to more. I guarantee, once you've tried it, you'll want to try it again. We're going to try for a whole week in the summer.
Presenter: OK, let's pause there then and see what our listeners have to say. You can call us here directly, or send us a message on any of our social media channels ... oops, should I be saying that? Anyway, more after the break. 



A lecture about an experiment
In today's lecture we're going to be talking about experiments, and I thought it might be interesting for you all to learn about the world's oldest continuously running laboratory experiment that is still going today. In fact, it holds the Guinness World Record for being the longest-running experiment. This experiment began in 1927 and has been going ever since.
It's called the 'pitch drop' experiment and it was created by Professor Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, Australia. Parnell was the university's first physics professor, and he wanted to show in this experiment that everyday materials, such as pitch, can have quite surprising properties.
You see, when pitch is at room temperature, it feels solid. You can easily break it with a hammer. However, it isn't in fact solid. At room temperature, pitch is many billions of times more viscous than water, but it's actually fluid.
In 1927, Professor Parnell took a sample of pitch. He heated it and poured it into a glass funnel. He allowed the pitch to cool and settle – for three years. He then turned the funnel upside down and cut the top off it.
Since then, the pitch has slowly dropped out of the funnel. How slowly? Well, the first drop took eight years to fall. It took another forty years for another five drops to fall. Today it's been almost 90 years since the experiment started. Only nine drops have fallen from the funnel. The last drop fell in April 2014 and the next one is expected to fall in the 2020s.
The experiment has a tragic story associated with it. Professor Parnell died without seeing a pitch drop. His replacement, Professor John Mainstone, became responsible for the pitch drop experiment from 1961. He held the job for 52 years, and missed seeing the drop fall three times – by a day in 1977, by just five minutes in 1988 and finally in 2000, when the webcam that was recording the experiment suffered a power outage for 20 minutes, during which time the pitch dropped.
The pitch drop experiment is something we can all participate in now. There's a live web stream that allows anyone to watch the glass funnel and wait for the fateful moment. A similar experiment to the Queensland pitch drop was set up in Dublin, and the video of the moment the pitch actually dropped went viral on the internet. It's interesting to see how a very slow event can spread news so quickly.



A talk about motivation
So, we think we know how to motivate people, right? Offer them a reward. Do this and you'll get this. Do this faster, earn more money. Do this better than everyone else, here's a promotion. We offer incentives when we want people to do things. We do it at work, at school, even at home with our kids. Tidy your room and you can watch TV.
But when social psychologists test whether incentives work, they get surprising results. Sam Glucksberg, from Princeton University, America, set people a problem to solve and told them he was going to time them to see how long they took. Then he put them in two groups. He offered one group a reward for finishing fast. Five dollars for anyone finishing in the top 25 per cent and 20 dollars for the person who finished the fastest of all. To the other group he offered no incentive, but he told them he was going to use their times to calculate an average time.
The first group, the ones with the reward, solved the problem faster, you'd think, right? Well, no, they actually took three and a half minutes longer than the group who just thought they were being timed. Incentive didn't work. In fact, it made them slower. This experiment has been repeated, with the same results, many times. But in business we still offer bonuses, promotions and rewards to staff.
That's fine if we want them to do something simple, like chop wood. We'll pay you more if you chop the wood faster. An incentive works then. But if we want someone to do something complex, something creative, something where they have to think, rewards don't work. They might even have the opposite result, and make people perform worse. Another study, by Dan Ariely, showed that the bigger the reward, the worse the subjects performed on a complex task. The reward made them focus so hard on the result that they couldn't think creatively any more.
And this all matters because more and more simple jobs will become automated. We'll be left with creative, problem-solving jobs that computers will never do. And we need to find a way to motivate people to do those jobs when we've proved the traditional incentives don't work.
So what does work? Giving your workers freedom; freedom to work on the things they want to work on, freedom to choose when, where and how they work. Want to work from home three days a week, get up late and work into the night instead? Fine. Just do the job well. And evidence shows people who choose the way they work get results. Companies that give employees time during the week to work on things that interest them and are not part of their regular job achieve amazing things. Some of the big tech companies are good examples of this, with ping-pong tables and areas to relax in …



Business news
The first item in the news today is the recent elections that took place across the country. This was a crucial vote, which may see a dramatic change in how the country develops over the coming years. Overall, a 54.5 per cent voter turnout was registered. This represents an increase of 11 per cent over the previous election and six per cent above the average for the past 50 years. There has also been a slight change in demographics, with an increase in youth turnout in the 18- to 24- and 24- to 29-year-old brackets. Despite this increase, young people are still less likely to vote than older people; 84 per cent of voters in the 70 plus age group came to the polling stations.
Moving on, the global digital powerhouse ONK today posted quarterly results which were above forecast. Back in March, Tim Bolling, CEO, issued a profit warning over fears that there would be losses following the recall of their leading product, the 40d device. In fact, the company posted quarterly revenue of US$14.8 billion which represents an increase of 11 per cent from the same quarter a year ago. They also announced that they had sold 21 million 40d devices over the quarter. The company has provided the information that with this level of revenue, there will be a gross margin of 34 to 35 per cent, ultimately leading to a US$1.20 per share cash dividend awarded to shareholders.
And in our final news item we ask, will we soon be saying goodbye to coins and notes forever? The nationwide trend of using cashless payment options is increasing. There are a number of reasons for this development. A key reason for this is a growing interest in reducing the number of items people need to leave their homes with. As almost everyone carries a smartphone with them, and many people also have smartwatches, the ability to pay for things using one of these two technologies is particularly appealing. More and more retailers are accepting cashless payments and in some cases they've stopped accepting cash altogether.



Creating a study group
Ali: Hey, you guys, I've been looking for you. I've got an idea – a study group. What do you think? Are you interested?
Dina: Yes! I need a study group, in a big way.
Bea: Me too.
Ali: Do you think we have enough people here for a study group? I mean, there are only four of us …
Bea: Sorry. Three of us. Chris can't do study group. Right, Chris?
Chris: Yeah, there's no way I can do a study group. I have an assignment and then I'm too busy. But I'll stay for this first meeting.
Ali: Should we try and get another group together with us for this?
Bea: No, I don't think so. I think three is fine. Ideal size, really.
Dina: Me too.
Ali: OK, three people then. Four people for the first meeting. What next?
Bea: What about a meeting place? We can't meet here in the library …
Ali: It's not too bad, especially if those other people would go away.
Bea: But we can't exactly ask them to leave, and people might get annoyed with us talking.
Dina: Can I say something here?
Ali: Sure, go ahead.
Dina: There's a study hall next to the cafeteria. It's almost always empty. Could we meet there?
Ali: A study hall?! Who knew? Well, it sounds good to me.
Bea: Yeah. I've never been there but …
Ali: So, we ought to decide how long for and how often.
Dina: I read somewhere that you should make the meeting at the same time each week. Like a seminar. That way we'd take it more seriously.
Bea: We may as well make it for this time since we're all here. Is this time OK?
Dina: Works for me.
Ali: Me too.
Chris: Hang on just a minute. I know I'm not going to be in this group, but aren't we supposed to have a seminar at this time every other week?
Dina: Umm, no.
Bea: Thursday, no? 
Ali: No, that's on Thursday. 
Chris: Sorry. Forget I said anything.
Ali: Don't worry about it.
Bea: So everyone agrees that this time is fine? Every week?
Ali: How long should we make it?
Bea: An hour?
Dina: Could we find a way of making it two hours?
Ali: Two hours seems a bit like … too much. To start with then?
Bea: Ninety minutes? Compromise?
Ali: Is that OK with you, Dina?
Dina: Fine by me.
Ali: OK, so I guess all we have left to decide is exactly what we'll do when we meet. The final exam is a way off. I guess we could review our notes, or practise learning things by heart.
Dina: I have a list of dos and don'ts actually that I got online. I could be a moderator, and we could use the ideas as a starting point …



Film reviews
Obviously, this is the sequel to Fun in the City, which is a film I didn't like so it's fair to say my expectations were low. So, you could say I wasn't disappointed, as it met my expectations. It was awful! It was so awful, I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it. But, that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you wasting your money going to see it.
So, it starts off with this big wedding scene. And, I won't go into why, but the whole scene is just there so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke ... it's just, ah, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then, instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all her friends. It's what directors do when they've run out of ideas … let's take our characters on tour!
Anyway, they gossip, cry and shop, and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Don't go and see it, you'll only encourage them to make another sequel. The world doesn't need three of these films. Please save your money and go and see the other big film this week: Twilight Mirror.
So, if you're a fan of the book it's based on, you're probably as excited as I was about this. For everyone else, this is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. I have to confess, I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them at all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cast either. So I went in not sure what to expect. But … I loved it.
One thing I really liked about it was the pace. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really well. The special effects brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But, more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters. The whole film worked on so many levels. It reminded me of going to the cinema as a child – how much fun that was. I can't recommend it enough.



Getting advice
Clara: Hi, how are you? I haven't seen you in class for a while.
Ben: Good, thanks. You? 
Clara: Great, as long as I don't think too hard about all the essays I have to write this term!
Ben: Yeah … 
Clara: Hey, are you OK?
Ben: I have to admit, I'm struggling a bit. Maybe even a lot. I've not been sleeping well at all and then I can't concentrate. And all these things are just going around and around in my head.
Clara: Mmm … that doesn't sound good. So, you're sleeping badly and you can't concentrate. Is that all it is, do you think?
Ben: Well, if I'm honest, it's more than that. I'm starting to dread going outside. I find myself worrying about stupid things like what if I forget the way home. Or, what if I go to class thinking it's Monday but actually it's Friday and I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. It sounds even more stupid when I say it out loud. It took me two hours to leave the house today.
Clara: It doesn't sound stupid at all. It actually sounds a lot like me last year.
Ben: Really? But you're so together!
Clara: I've learned to be, but even I still have bad days. I used to have panic attacks and everything. When you were trying to leave the house today, how did you feel?
Ben: Like I couldn't breathe. And my heart was going way too fast.
Clara: Hmm … that sounds like a panic attack to me.
Ben: I thought I was going to die.
Clara: You'd be surprised how common they are. Loads of people have them, they just don't talk about it.
Ben: How did you get over them?
Clara: I actually talked to a doctor about it, and you should too. But I learned some practical things as well. Though they're easier said than done, and they're going to sound weird, so hear me out, OK?
Ben: OK …
Clara: So, one thing I did was to try to reduce the power of the anxiety and the panic attacks when they came. So – and this may sound strange – at a time when you're feeling safe and OK, you literally do things that make your heart start racing faster and your breathing speed up. Like spinning around on a chair until you're dizzy or hyperventilating so you're short of breath.
Ben: That sounds awful!
Clara: It is, but it means you get used to the symptoms, so they feel less scary. 
Ben: Right. 
Clara: Then you have to deliberately do the things that usually make you feel panic. So, if it's going to class on Monday and being scared you've got the wrong day, on Monday you go to class. If you let the anxiety control you by making you stay at home, it just makes it worse the next time you really do have to go out.
Ben: And what did you do if a panic attack came anyway?
Clara: I had a distraction plan. So, I walked everywhere instead of taking the bus because the exercise helped, but also I did things like count trees or red cars or something. Whatever it was didn't matter, as long as I had something else to focus on.
Ben: I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I thought … 



Joining a gym
Receptionist: Hello, welcome to Shake it Off Fitness. How can I help you?
Customer: Yes, thanks. I've been meaning to come in and find some information about here for some time. I was wondering if you could help me?
Receptionist: Sure, of course. What would you like to know?
Customer: I saw on the sign outside that you have the best budget membership in the city. Is that right?
Receptionist: You've got that right, yes. If you find a better rate, then we'll match it. Also, we don't have any sign-up fees or cancellation fees.
Customer: Sorry, what was that last bit?
Receptionist: Cancellation fees. Some gyms charge you money if you leave before a minimum number of months or something like that. We don't do that.
Customer: That's useful to know. Ummm, what times do you have?
Receptionist: We open at 5 a.m. and close at midnight.
Customer: Not 24 hours then, I see.
Receptionist: No. Almost, though! We tried doing the 24-hour thing, but there really weren't a lot of people who wanted to do exercise at 2 in the morning.
Customer: Makes sense. Another question: do you have trainers? Like, will you do a personalised evaluation of me?
Receptionist: Sure we do. As we say on our brochure, we can show you what to do, how to do it and why you're doing it. Have you worked with a personal trainer before?
Customer: Err, no. No, I haven't. No.
Receptionist: So, it's very easy. For your first visits we'll assign you one of our expert personal trainers. He or she will design an exercise plan that's just right for you and show you exactly what to do. We even include nutrition advice in the plan.
Customer: Let me get this straight. All of this is included in the price?
Receptionist: Yes, it is. If you want to continue with your trainer after the first few classes, we can talk about that. It does cost extra though. OK?
Customer: Yeah. Sounds ... great.
Receptionist: Do you have any other questions?
Customer: Hmmm, yeah. Um, OK. Why should I choose here instead of any of the other gyms in the city?
Receptionist: What, you mean apart from our competitive rates and personalised attention?
Customer: Yeah, I guess.
Receptionist: Listen, here's a free day pass. Why don't you drop by and see for yourself? That way you can talk to other members, see the facilities and our staff.
Customer: OK, I'll do that. Thanks very much!



Office party planning
Ayako: Hello, sales department. This is Ayako speaking. How can I help you?
Sam: Hi, Ayako, this is Sam from Events-4-U. I'm calling about the piano you want at your Christmas party next month.
Ayako: Oh, good. It would be a great surprise to have one there for our boss for the night. He can play and it would be a great addition for the party. Have you been able to source one?
Sam: Well, yes, I have, but …
Ayako: But what?
Sam: Well, we're going to either have an issue with the logistics or the budget, or possibly both.
Ayako: Oh dear.
Sam: Well, we've found a baby grand piano, as you requested, and it's available for the date you want.
Ayako: OK, great. So what's the issue? Is it too expensive?
Sam: No, it's within the budget you gave me, so everything there is OK. But it's too wide for the entrance doorway into the building.
Ayako: Oh, I see. So what are our options? Could we dismantle it outside and reassemble it inside?
Sam: Er, no. Unfortunately, you can't really do that with pianos. But don't worry, I'm sure we can find some inventive solution.
Ayako: Do you have any ideas?
Sam: Well, we could hoist it up to the first-floor balcony. The door there would be large enough to fit it through.
Ayako: Great. That sounds like a good plan.
Sam: That would work, though it would increase the cost considerably as we'd need a crane, an extension on the insurance policy and probably two to three additional people to manage getting it successfully into the building.
Ayako: Oh, I see. Well, we can definitely stretch the budget by about ten per cent, but we shouldn't go over that. If we exceed the budget by more than ten per cent, then other areas of the party budget will have to be cut. And we don't really want that.
Sam: OK, so this idea won't work then. Sorry if I wasn't being clear. The considerable budget increase I was referring to would add a further fifty per cent. You know, cranes are expensive.
Ayako: Oh … um … OK. So what other options do we have?
Sam: Well, how fixed are you on the piano being a baby grand? Would an upright piano be an option?
Ayako: Hmm. I don't know.
Sam: It would fit through the door on the ground floor and cause fewer problems. I've also got the option on a really nice white vintage upright piano, with black design work.
Ayako: OK. That sounds like it might work. Could you send me over some photos of it?
Sam: I'll do it now, together with the rental and delivery information and costs.
Ayako: Great. Thanks, Sam. Let me think about it and I'll call you back later today.
Sam: Sure, no problem. I'll wait for your call. 



Talking about rumours
Will: Kiera, have you heard John isn't coming back and they might even fire him?
Kiera: No! I knew he was away but I thought it was for personal reasons?
Will: I'm pretty sure that's not the full story. Have you ever worked with him?
Kiera: A long time ago, but … well, I've heard stories about him for years.
Will: I've never worked with him directly but I know people that have and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Susanne told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project and she brought it up at the monthly creative workshop and he liked it – everybody did. But she saw the notes from the meeting and there was no mention of her name anywhere. John had agreed with her and repeated some of the things she said and the notes made it look like they were his ideas in the first place. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started – it was that cars one – Susanne was moved to something else.
Kiera: It won an award, didn't it?
Will: Yeah, but Susanne didn't get to share it – there was zero recognition of her contribution. She was furious but she couldn't do anything about it. Not if she wanted to keep her job.
Kiera: Yeah, it's almost impossible to report people who are as high up as John is, or was.
Will: How did you find working with him, then?
Kiera: Well, you know what you said about him shouting at people? I've been in meetings with him and we all learned to keep our mouths shut. It was horrible. People were genuinely afraid of him.
Will: Did you ever see him stealing people's ideas?
Kiera: It was never that obvious. He was a genius. He had incredible vision but, you know, there was a whole team of people working with him. Not every single idea came from him and after a while it's not easy to say, 'Oh, this idea was mine and this idea was yours.' For me, the bigger problem was that you could be in his good books and then suddenly, with no explanation, you were out. And if you were out, life got very difficult.
Will: I heard women in particular had a hard time working with him.
Kiera: Yeah, well, like I said, you had to stay in his good books. So, if there was a comment that made you feel uncomfortable, you didn't say anything.
Will: Did that happen to you?
Kiera: Not to me, no, but we all knew … and no one said anything. And I was lucky I didn't have that much contact with him myself.
Will: They're doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light.
Kiera: I hope so. I really hope he's not coming back.



Sailing solo across the Atlantic
In 2007, Michael Perham, a fourteen-year-old boy from the south of England, became the youngest person to sail across the Atlantic alone. Michael set off from Gibraltar on the 5600 kilometre voyage which took forty-seven days. It was a long and, some may say, dangerous adventure, but Michael was determined to get there.
Michael started sailing when he was seven, and says the idea of an Atlantic crossing had been floating around in his head for a few years. Then one day, his father, Peter, who's a keen sailor, decided that the time was right. Michael helped with the design of a new 9-metre yacht which was built for them and to which Michael gave the name 'Cheeky Monkey'.
They say that for a real sailor, crossing the Atlantic isn't a big deal, but people imagine that sharks and huge waves would be the greatest dangers. In fact, Michael's father sailed alongside his son in his own boat to make sure he was OK. They worked in shifts throughout the night; an hour on, then an hour off, because one of them had to be on watch, in case large ships came too near to them.
Are you wondering what Michael ate during his voyage? Well, he says he and his father filled two supermarket trolleys with things like sausages, spaghetti and stews, which could be easily heated in a pan. Everything had to be in tins, though, because that type of food keeps fresher than stuff in packets or jars.
So what did Michael miss most? He says he sometimes missed human contact and having a face-to-face conversation. He got used to his limited food supply but says what he really longed for was hot toast. Knowing what teenagers are like, I'd been expecting him to say burgers or crisps, but then Michael is no ordinary teenager!
When asked how he communicated with his father, Michael explains that it was all done by radio, though for Michael nothing compared with the pleasure of following his father's progress through his binoculars. Michael also communicated with his family at home by satellite phone. One day his father contacted Michael to tell him a part of his own boat was broken, which really disappointed Michael because it might mean that they would have to go slower. But, in the end, that wasn't necessary.
I asked Michael how he entertained himself on the boat. He told me he'd taken his guitar with him but it had stayed in its case throughout the trip. He couldn't play because the boat was always rolling about! He loved to read and he also had an iPod that his sister had lent him. This he plugged into portable speakers and it was on pretty much all the time.
Was there anything that frightened Michael? He says the weather was a bit of a worry at times, and once he got caught in a force-nine storm, but managed to handle the boat OK. The one event that really shook him was when a flying fish jumped into the boat and hit him on the shoulder. But mostly things were great. like sailing alongside dolphins and seeing the blues: skies anyone could ever imagine.
Everybody is really proud of Michael's achievements. And a remarkable thing about the trip is that he also raised thousands of pounds for the charity known as 'Children in Need'. His school has been very supportive - the headteacher allowed Michael to miss school, saying that a few weeks on the ocean would be an amazing learning experience.
It's quite likely that Michael's next challenge will be to sail non-stop around the world. His father would do the trip in another boat, but it would be a very different experience because they would be in 20- metre boats which travel much faster, so they would never really be in sight of each other. Michael says next time he'll remember to pack some photos, to remember friends and family if he feels lonely, but he'll leave the guitar at home!



Cookery courses
Speaker 1 There's such a vast range of cookery schools, it's unbelievable. Before booking a course, it's advisable to decide what you want from it. For me it was easy - I wanted to pick up some new ideas for entertaining but didn't need any basic techniques, so the course at the Brandale cookery school suited me well. There were some people there who didn't know how to boil an egg, but there was extra tuition for them. The course is run by Sylvie Brandale, who's written cookbooks and appeared on TV, and subjects included 'Stress-free parties' and 'Sauces from around the world'. All great topics and all of the ingredients were provided.
Speaker 2 I was very lucky, really. I was on holiday, and I happened to hear that there was a new cookery school at the nearby Four Seasons Hotel. They had four-hour classes every Saturday, starting at 7 am! The day I attended there was a group of ten enthusiastic participants, all eagerly awaiting instructions - though I gathered from their conversations that, unlike me, they were all fairly experienced cooks. You can imagine the look on our faces though when we were told we were going to visit the open-air fish market down by the port. We all came back having selected freshly caught seafood, and were then taught the art of preparing it. Great stuff!
Speaker 3 I'm a good cook, or so my sister says. So she thought I'd do an advanced course. But I was keen to go through the basics again, and this time I was determined to enjoy it. I registered for Glyn Harvey's cookery classes - only four people in a class. We watched while he prepared the dishes, making it all seem so effortless! There wasn't much real cooking, although he did invite us to help slice the potatoes and tomatoes. And we were given some tasty, easy-to-cook recipes to take home. I came away bursting with ideas for giving a dinner party - something I hadn't felt like doing in a long time.
Speaker 4 The course I attended covered a range of techniques, from basic to advanced, and it gave you lots of practical tips. I was there to make up for the fact that, sadly, as a youngster. I was hardly ever allowed into the kitchen, which meant I'd turned into a chuck-it in- the-pan sort of cook. Claire, the teacher, was very chatty and full of enthusiasm. She demonstrated several dishes in the morning while we took notes, and then we were given some equipment and it was our turn to have a go. I made a splendid vegetable tart, which we ate at lunch. Now I'm planning to go again and this time I'll concentrate on the more demanding recipes.
Speaker 5 This weekend cookery course I did, had an emphasis on local ingredients, with hands-on practice with the chefs. I wouldn't have been happy with taking notes and following demonstrations, no matter how impressive the food produced. I wanted to get my hands dirty, just as I'd done as a little girl in school cookery lessons. It was at a seaside resort, and you stay in a hotel which is very close to the fishing port, and so get to cook the local seafood. It's really intensive and you cook two-course lunches as well as four-course dinners! But you get enough free time to make it an enjoyable weekend too.



Interview with Pamela Green, a young fashion designer
Interviewer: Hello, Pamela, welcome to the programme. So many young people want to be fashion designers these days, but don't know how to get started.
Pamela Green: Hi. I felt exactly like that myself! You must first discover if this is really what you want to do. I wasn't sure to begin with, so I started off by looking for a store in my neighbourhood that sold its own clothes. The owner invited me into her studio and told me what a typical day was like. She allowed me to ask as many questions as I wanted. Having made up my mind, I then contacted a few colleges to see what courses in fashion were on offer, and I was lucky to find one that seemed ideal.
Interviewer: So a degree in fashion is a must?
Pamela Green: Well, you often meet designers who go to college later in life, after years of working in the industry. The truth is the best students aren't always the best designers, but there's no denying that a degree will show that you've got certain basic skills and get you your first job. Don't be surprised to find colleagues with fewer qualifications on higher pay than yourself though. Making progress from that point will depend entirely on your personal talent.
Interviewer: What basic skills do you need?
Pamela Green: When you ask a fashion student what they want to do, they often reply 'have my own line'. Not an easy task, I must say. You need work experience first, ideally in a successful fashion shop, to understand that this industry is led by commerce. Starting your own line requires capital and a clear overview of how it's going to develop. Without it, clothes design can only be a hobby. Of course, if you've got an eye for colour, style and shape and an ability to draw, you shouldn't let go of the dream.
Interviewer: Where do you get the inspiration for your designs?
Pamela Green: To be a good designer, you have to be aware of the world you live in, you need to go out and look at people's lives and attitudes, you really have to learn how to observe what's happening around you. And I don't mean going abroad necessarily - my social circle is invaluable for me, for example - a constant source of ideas. You have to remember the clothes are not for you, you have to adapt to what other people want. And don't be tempted to imitate the famous designers, however beautiful their collections might look.
Interviewer: Now you're a successful designer, are things easier?
Pamela Green: It took me a while to learn to cope with criticism, though. You think your design drawings look brilliant, but you mustn't get upset if the garment doesn't look as you'd imagined it. What I've never managed to get used to is the sheer amount of work involved in finishing your collection well in advance of the season. Some designers stop attending fashion shows, for example, which involve lots of time-consuming travelling, but I'd be unhappy to give that up.
Interviewer: Do you have to do a lot of reading to keep up with trends?
Pamela Green: You have to read fashion magazines and other media that reflect current trends and tastes. It doesn't matter whether you want to use them in your own designs. Nobody knows what styles will be fashionable in, say, two years' time, but the point is you have to know just about everything that's been done before, so that you can spot it when it becomes popular again.
Interviewer: This is a very competitive industry. Realistically, what are the chances for somebody starting?
Pamela Green: Don't make the mistake of aiming just for designing outfits, which is just one part of a vast industry. You may be perfectly happy as an obscure but competent designer of small pieces for collections - jewellery, hats, shoes - all of which need to be created. And then somebody has to market them, sell them, write about them. Fame and glory is just for the top twenty world designers, and life isn't always wonderful even for them.
Interviewer: Pamela, many thanks.



The Mysterious Monster
Loch Ness, a large inland lake in Scotland, is one of the most famous tourist sites in the world - and this is not simply because of its stunning beauty. Mostly, it is because of the mystery of the 'Monster' that may hide in its waters. The Monster, known affectionately as Nessie, is said to have a huge, dark body and a long neck and its head has been described as small and similar to a sheep's. So, what is the actual evidence for its existence?
What captured people's imaginations in 1933 was the publication of a picture of the monster in a London newspaper. This photograph was called 'the surgeon's picture', because that was the profession of the man who took it. Many people had doubts about it, but the photo matched the descriptions of the monster by other eyewitnesses.
The best known film evidence for the creature is a cine film of something large moving at speed through the water. It was taken in 1960 by a man called Tim Dinsdale. It was shot from the mouth of a river which runs into Loch Ness from the south. Many critics said it was probably a boat, but when Dinsdale submitted the film for analysis by experts, they concluded that this was definitely not the case.
Tim Dinsdale thought that the monster was very probably a prehistoric animal, one that people believed to be extinct. On a more practical note, he discovered that sightings of Nessie tended to happen on fine days and that Nessie-spotting was a waste of time on windy or rainy days. However, if you visit Loch Ness, you'll see lots of tourists spending hours staring at the loch in any weather, in the hope of spotting the monster.
Undoubtedly, some sightings are the product of wishful thinking or the mistaken identification of objects on the loch. But for the most part, the accounts are those of honest people who insist they do not seek publicity but simply want to tell their amazing tale. With so many sightings, researchers eventually came to the conclusion that it would be worth spending the time and money needed to investigate it scientifically.
In 1962 the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau was set up, and in 1968 the first serious underwater investigation of the loch was launched. Up to that point, the only technology available had been photography, but now sonar equipment was available, which is the underwater equivalent of radar. Though there were some strong contacts with a large moving object, the results were inconclusive.
In 1969 a small private submarine came to the loch with the intention of firing darts at the creature to get a sample of its skin. But like many others before and since, this project was defeated by the poor visibility because the dirty waters of Loch Ness contain large amounts of peat, a type of black soil. This also explains why television cameras cannot be used down there.
So what else could be done? There was, for a time, a serious suggestion to bring in a number of dolphins to join the researchers, but it soon became clear that this was a non-starter. The obstacles would have been enormous, starting with the logistical problems of transporting them and then feeding them.
In 1972, new computer-enhancement techniques were introduced. Dr Robert Rines, of the Academy of Applied Science in Boston, succeeded in taking a picture which is now famous. Using a special flash, he photographed what appears to be the flipper of a huge animal. If it is, then it belongs to a creature unknown to science. Naturally this provoked a storm of controversy, which shows no signs of dying down.
So what's the latest? Using the most modern technology, there's now a project to investigate all the loch's plants and animals, some of which have probably never been seen due to the incredible depth of the water. But will the monster offer itself for examination? Who knows! For nearly 1500 years the legend of the Loch Ness monster has persisted and the elusive beast still continues to exert its magnetism across the world.



Concerts
Speaker 1 The concert went on for three hours and it featured a variety of bands. I'd have preferred something shorter and of higher quality, to be honest. The first band to come on, The Beats, didn't seem to have rehearsed their set very well. Nice catchy rhythms, but otherwise it was a mess. What made the evening worthwhile for me was the fact that all profits from ticket sales were going to a charity devoted to child care. There was a huge audience because you don't often get the chance to see so many bands at one venue, and only for a few dollars.
Speaker 2 This was a concert by Brighton Club, a great rock band just back from a successful tour of Latin America. But the first part was all new stuff - and a bit boring. And although everyone was shouting out the titles of songs they wanted to hear, the band took no notice, which was a shame. I mean it's a bit bad when you finally get the chance to see your favourite band live and then they refuse to play their best songs. Anyway, after a while, we all started getting into the new material and by the end the audience response was great. So I don't think anybody minded the forty dollars they'd paid.
Speaker 3 This was a concert by Celia Samson and her band, who play pop with some touches of jazz and country. She's got a beautiful voice, but the rest of the band let her down rather. At times it felt a bit like a high-school recital, with the audience clapping and cheering all the time when there was nothing much to shout about. All fine and good, except I don't particularly enjoy paying thirty dollars for a highschool performance where profits go to second-class musicians. Mind you, I've paid that kind of money in the past for concerts to help research, or to fight world poverty, but that's a different thing entirely.
Speaker 4 This was a concert by the Brenda Amis band. I wouldn't have wanted to miss the beginning - a huge cloud of smoke swelled on the stage, and out of it emerged Brenda Amis, with jet-black hair piled up with a feather and a big flower on top. I know some people would've wanted her to include her latest songs, but I was happy enough that the night was all about the old favourites I've listened to so many times. At the end, she had a short exchange with the audience: 'Thanks so much, guys. You're so nice.', and then she sang 'Only for Big Girls', and got a standing ovation
Speaker 5 This was a gig by the Sam Barnes Band. Sam's my favourite guitarist right now. His approach to the instrument is the complete opposite to tradition - he'll hold the guitar upside down with the neck touching the ground. The music's punk and he's got a great band, particularly the bass player and the drummer. They've done some CDs, but they've never yet made a record that really captures what they do on stage. You're less likely to be impressed by their recordings, but people were just stunned at the gig, it blew everybody's mind. I only wished they'd played more of my favourite tracks, but you can't
