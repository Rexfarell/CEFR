You hear a public announcement at a family theme park.
Attention everybody. This is Sonia Lee and I’m events manager
for today at Seaworld Centre. If you hurry to Zone D you can
catch the spectacular ‘riding with dolphins’ event. The next one’s
on at 5 past 11, but don’t worry if you miss that, because you’ve
got three more chances to see it today. We’ll now be feeding
the sea lions at 2.15, that’s 45 minutes later than scheduled
according to your programmes. And whatever you do, don’t miss
the ever-popular Penguin Walkabout. That starts in half an hour.
You’ve never seen anything like it! See you there!
