I made the big mistake of going to a college fairly
near my home. It isn’t so much the course that I
don’t like, but the fact that I’m stuck at my parents’
house so I don’t feel in touch with what’s going on
at campus. In some ways I’m lucky because I’m not
paying out all the money for food and rent that other
people have to find, and I have someone to do my
washing, but I don’t have the same amount of
freedom or privacy as the people who’re living away
from home. I even have to share a room with my
younger brother. When I told my parents I wanted to
move out and go into college accommodation, they
said they’d stop supporting me financially. So, in
the end, I had to give up the idea, that hasn’t made
any of us very happy.
