Work with vegetables
We supply over 400 of London’s restaurants. The vegetables
come from our stores deep in the heart of the wholesale
market where in the very early hours of the morning, the
orders are packed and loaded onto vans for delivery later
that day. Our work begins as the restaurants are shutting.
The chefs have finished cooking and they’re planning the
next day’s menu which means placing their orders for fruit
and veg with us. It gets really tough in the run up to
midnight when everyone phones us at once with their
requests. We don’t catch up on paperwork until the
afternoon – if we’re lucky!
