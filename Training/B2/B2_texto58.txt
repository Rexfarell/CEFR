The city where I study is appalling for cheap
accommodation, and the college has nothing of
its own to offer you, but I was lucky, I found a
room in a nice little terraced house with central
heating which I share with three other girls. I
have a yearly contract with a private landlady
and I pay £220 a month for my study bedroom.
This is not bad as it also has a large walk-in
wardrobe where I put all my stuff. I share the
bathroom, kitchen and a small living room with
the other girls, and we split all the bills between
us. We tried to make a rota for the washing up,
cleaning and putting out the rubbish, but it’s not
always strictly followed. Cooking your own food
is much cheaper than eating at college, and I like
it because I have what I want when I want it.
