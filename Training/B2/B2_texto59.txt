I live in a college-owned self-catering block. There’s
not much luxury, but I get value for money. For my
£38 per week rent, I get a reasonably-sized room with
an old wardrobe, a tiny desk, one shelf, a rather
stained carpet and a sink. When I first moved in, I
probably spent more on decoration than I did on
food. My only real complaint, though, was that I had
to buy a new pillow because the one I was provided
with felt like a plastic bag full of old towels. I share
the kitchen and bathroom with six other girls. One of
them has a TV in her room, but she is a bit possessive
about it. The fridge is not huge, so you’re always
trying to squeeze your food into the last remaining
inch of space. I twice set off the fire alarm by
burning my dinner, so tended to give up on cooking
after that. We eat a lot of take-aways. In the next
block there’s a games room where we hang out
which has things like table football and satellite TV
if you need a break from studying.
