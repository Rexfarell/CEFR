As a result of heavy snow, there has been major disruption to
rail services this morning. A number of breakdowns have been
reported in the west, with people stranded on some trains. In
this region blizzard conditions are making driving conditions
hazardous. A severely restricted train service will be operating
within the next few hours into the capital and delays are
expected on all lines in the south of the country. In the north,
there is some snow, but services have been able to continue,
with only a few cancellations reported.
