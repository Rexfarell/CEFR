MAN: How do you like it now you’re head of department?
WOMAN: Fine, I really want to make some changes though.
Lots of parents just can’t afford to keep buying new books
you know for their children. They’re just too expensive –
we really need to bring the price down. The schools can’t
afford them either so there are all these lovely new books
and they’re just sitting in stock rooms not being sold.
The booksellers do their best to promote them but they do
keep telling us the price needs to be more competitive. It’s
time we took some notice because we’re losing money and
nobody is benefiting, least of all the children.
