Tomas from Vienna
I'm Tomas and I live in Vienna with my parents and my sisters. I'm the youngest in my family. I turned 13 last month. My sisters are Martina, 16, and Betta, 19. Betta's very serious and she always tells me what to do, I guess because she's the oldest. I go to a nice school not too far from our home and I really enjoy it. I have a lot of friends there and I enjoy studying. My best subject is Geography, probably because it's the easiest too! My most difficult subject is Math - I'm terrible and I don't like my teacher. I love playing sports, especially basketball. I'm the tallest player on the school team and I usually play really well. It's the happiest part of my day. My coach says that one day I could play professional basketball! On the weekend I spend a lot of time with my friends Ralf and Kurt. We do everything together and they are the most important people in my life, apart from my family of course!
