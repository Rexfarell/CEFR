The Party
The band at this party are playing very loudly.
The happy pair are having the first dance.
There’s plenty of food and drink for everyone.
Some people are sitting quietly, doing nothing.
The Movers are having fun and making lots of
noise. Look for them under the table, upstairs
and downstairs. Let’s hope they will be careful
and not fall! There are so many things to do at
a party!
