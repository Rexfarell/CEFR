out playing, they are in a darkened room,
glued to the TV set, zapping aliens on
their Nintendos or surfing the Internet.
As their friends ride their bikes, go

play are those on the computer, and their
only pet is the mouse.
For thousands of
children the
computer and the
TV now dominate
their lives, turning
them into
electronic junkies
with virtual childhoods where real
relationships are replaced by artificial ones.
Many children, too, begin their TV
viewing early and finish late.
Programmes designed to entertain young
viewers begin in the early morning.
So parents may still be in bed when their
children are already up and channel
hopping.
According to an American study for the
U.S. National Institute of Education, ten
hours TV watching a week is a healthy
level and any more than that results in
under performance at school and an
unhealthy lifestyle.
