My name is Jhon
Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is John Smith. I am 19 and a student in college. I go to college in New York. My favorite courses are Geometry, French, and History. English is my hardest course. My professors are very friendly and smart. It’s my second year in college now. I love it!
I live in a big house on Ivy Street. It’s near the college campus. I share the house with three other students. Their names are Bill, Tony, and Paul. We help each other with homework. On the weekend, we play football together.
I have a younger brother. He just started high school. He is 14 and lives with my parents. They live on Mulberry Street in Boston. Sometimes they visit me in New York. I am happy when they visit. My Mom always brings me sweets and candy when they come. I really miss them, too!



My Wonderful Familiy
I live in a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one sister, and I was born last. My father teaches mathematics, and my mother is a nurse at a big hospital. My brothers are very smart and work hard in school. My sister is a nervous girl, but she is very kind. My grandmother also lives with us. She came from Italy when I was two years old. She has grown old, but she is still very strong. She cooks the best food!
My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My brothers and I like to go on long walks in the mountains. My sister likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board games together. We laugh and always have a good time. I love my family very much.



Our Vacation
Every year we go to Florida. We like to go to the beach.
My favorite beach is called Emerson Beach. It is very long, with soft sand and palm trees. It is very beautiful. I like to make sandcastles and watch the sailboats go by. Sometimes there are dolphins and whales in the water!
Every morning we look for shells in the sand. I found fifteen big shells last year. I put them in a special place in my room. This year I want to learn to surf. It is hard to surf, but so much fun! My sister is a good surfer. She says that she can teach me. I hope I can do it!



Preparing Food

He cracked the eggs into a bowl. He stirred the eggs. Then, he poured them into the hot skillet. He waited while the eggs cooked. They cooked for two minutes. He heard them cooking. They popped in the oil.
Next, Jack put the eggs on a plate. He placed the plate on the dining room table. Jack loved looking at his eggs. They looked pretty on the white plate. He sat down in the large wooden chair. He thought about the day ahead. He ate the eggs with a spoon. They were good.
He washed the plate with dishwashing soap. Then, he washed the pan. He got a sponge damp. Finally, he wiped down the table. Next, Jack watched TV.

My name is Annie and this is what I normally do 
My name is Annie and this is what I normally do. I love to walk on the mountain.
During the week, I wake up early and go for a small walk on the mountain.  I usually go with my father or my brother.  We like to get some fresh air before we start our day.
We live in a country far away from the city.  We think that our country’s life is wonderful because we are away from the noise and pollution of the city.
We often walk for about one-half hour and then return to our home.  I always take my bus after our walk at about 8:30 a.m. and arrive at school at 9:00 a.m.
My father takes his car and goes to town to work.  He works at a veterinary clinic.  He is a vet and loves to help animals.  We have 3 dogs and two cats.
On the weekend we wake up early and go for a hike on the mountain.  It is so nice to smell the fresh air and see the wild animals. We stay there for about three hours and bring our lunch with us.  As you can see my family loves nature.



My office
Like most offices, my office is a place where I can concentrate on my work and feel comfortable at the same time.
Of course, I have all the necessary equipment on my desk. I have the telephone next to the fax machine on the right side of my desk. My computer is in the center of my desk with the monitor directly in front of me.
I have a comfortable office chair to sit on and some pictures of my family between the computer and the telephone.
In order to help me read, I also have a lamp near my computer which I use in the evening if I work late.
There is plenty of paper in one of the cabinet drawers. There are also staples and a stapler, paper clips, highlighters, pens and erasers in the other drawer.
In the room, there is a comfortable armchair and a sofa to sit on. I also have a low table in front of the sofa on which there are some industry magazines.





My Art Class
One of the things I like best about school is my art class. We have a great teacher named Mrs. Hilbert. She is a wonderful artist.
I love to watch her draw and paint. She taught us how to mix paint to make just the right colors for our paintings. She plays good music while we draw and paint.
We draw and paint almost everyday in class. Some days we look at pictures of other artists. It is interesting to do this. It helps me to think of things that I want to paint or draw.
We have an art exhibit in May this year. Our work will be in one of the banks in our town. We are inviting people from the community to our exhibit. Our parents are invited to go with us.
I have three paintings I am working on now. I hope one of them will be chosen to be in the exhibit. I like having a goal to work toward.

A day in the life of Paula Radcliffe - Marathon Runner
8.30am
Sometimes, my daughter Isla wakes me and my husband, Gary, up, or, more often, we wake her up. After I get up, I always check my pulse. It's usually 38-40 beats per minute. If it is too high, I rest for the day. It's so important to listen to my body. I have a drink and a snack while giving Isla her breakfast.
9.30am
We take Isla to nursery and then I start my training. I run, and Gary rides his bike next to me and gives me drinks. Four times a week, I have a cold bath or go for a swim in a lake after training.
12.30pm
I pick up Isla from nursery and we go home and I eat a big lunch of cereal and fruit. Then I have rice and salmon, or toast and peanut butter. I try to eat as soon as possible after training. After lunch, I play with my daughter.
2pm
I have a nap in the afternoon, and Gary usually takes Isla out while I sleep. When I wake up, I have a drink and a snack while Isla has milk. I eat a lot during the day, especially bananas and dark chocolate.
5pm
I go running again. In total, I run about 145 miles every week. I write about all my runs in my training journal. I record everything, including how I feel and what the weather is like. I train hard every other day, go on an extra long run every four days and rest every eighth day.
7pm
In the evening, I do my exercises. These keep me strong during long runs. Isla likes to climb on me while I stretch. Gary gives Isla her tea and cooks mine while I finish my exercises. Then I finish cooking dinner while Gary gives Isla her bath. 
7.30pm
Gary and I eat our dinner. I have red meat four times a week with rice, pasta or potatoes, and lots of vegetables. We also eat a lot of stir-fries, because they're quick and healthy.
8pm
We put Isla to bed and relax. I check my emails and watch TV or chat with Gary. I love police and hospital dramas!
10.30pm
Time for bed. As I brush my teeth, I stand on one leg and then the other. This keeps my legs strong.  I enjoy reading, but I haven’t read much since Isla was born.



Cars and weather make life worse
PEOPLE living in Washington D.C. can expect a
summer of bad air warnings, officials say. Hotter
temperatures together with dirt from increased
road traffic will severly reduce the quality of the
air in the city. 



High cost of living
OXFORD is now the town with the most expensive
houses in the State of Missouri. The typical home
sale in the state is $111,092, says a new report.



Weather and homes are better in Spain
SPANISH prisoners in Lincoln, Nebraska
say they get poor medical service because
of their language problems. They want
more help with the language and need
$1,000,000 to pay for their own teachers.

The first english class
Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some information about the class.
Our class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs, turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13.
We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes, so we finish at 6 p.m. That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK?
Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office 7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if you have any questions or problems or want to talk to me, it's Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.
We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the 13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last day.
I think that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1 Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to see any photocopies of the book, thank you! Remember, it's level 1 student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book.
I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you. See you next Monday!



A good night sleep
Host: At exam time it is important to sleep well. Today we have Doctor Baker with us in the studio and he is going to give us five top tips for getting a good night’s sleep. Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. 
Dr Baker: Thank you. It’s great to be here. Let’s start with tip one. Don’t go to bed with the television on. Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don’t really sleep well, so turn it off!
Tip two: Don’t think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening. Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep.
Tip three: Don’t play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy and active. 
Tip four: Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can’t wait until the morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room. 
Tip five: Play music if you like. But don’t play it too loud. Turn the sound down low.
Host: Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners.

Lupita's Day
Hello. My name is Lupita Gonzalez. I
work in a large company in
Monterrey, Mexico. We make
bottles and cans for soft drinks. I
am a secretary. I answer the
telephone and take messages. I also
use a fax machine and a computer.
My first language is Spanish but
sometimes I speak English. Many of
our clients are from the United
States. My supervisor is Mr.
Torres. He is an engineer. I start
work at 8:00. I usually drive to
work. I have lunch from 1:00 to 2:00. I finish work at 5:30. I go
home and help my mother prepare
dinner. We have dinner at 9:00.
After dinner I usually watch
television a while. I usually go to
bed at 11:00.



Dear mom and dad,
Well I want to tell you about my first
week of classes at the University. I get
up at 6:00 every morning. That is really
early for me. I don't like to get up early
you know. I usually eat breakfast in the
school cafeteria. The food here is
pretty good. I have German class every
morning at 7:30. After German class I
have Business and Economics on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at 10:00. I have
a lot of homework in that class but I
really like it. I also have English
Composition on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I
have United States History.
The campus here is really big. After
some problems during the first days, I
now know where all the buildings and
classrooms are. My dormitory is close so
I walk to all my classes.
My roommate's name is Eric. He is from
Los Angeles. We are good friends now.
He is quiet and doesn't make a lot of
noise. Sometimes Eric and I have dinner
together. We don't see each other
much because our school programmes
are really different.
During the evening I study. Sometimes I
study in the library and sometimes in
the dormitory. I usually go to bed
around eleven.
Mom, I sure miss your
cooking. Could you
send me some of your
homemade chocolate
cookies? Well, I have
to go. Take care.
Love,
Jerry



Pedro's House
Pedro is from Portugal. He lives
with his parents in Lisbon in an old
house by the sea. The house is not
big but he likes it very much.
There are three bedrooms upstairs;
one for his parents, one for his
sister and one for him. The
bathroom and the living room are
downstairs. In the living room there
is a lovely fireplace. Next to the
living room is the kitchen. The
kitchen is not modern but they have
a new washing machine.
In the evening, all the family sit in
the living room to watch TV and
have dinner. At the back of the
house there is a small but very
beautiful garden with different
plants and flowers. His father likes
to spend his free time there.
Pedro likes to spend most of his
time at home in his bedroom.It’s
also his study room where he has a
desk and a stereo. He loves his room
because he can see the sea from
the window.It’s a fantastic view.




Hi Andrew,
Nice to hear from you. Replying to your email, here is some information about my
family and me. I am from Tangier, north of Morocco. I have a sister and a brother:
Leila 14 and Jamal 11. I am 16 years old. My father is a fireman and my mother is a
nurse. We live in a small but nice house by the sea.
I am taller than my mother and I weigh 54 kilos. That’slessthanmysisterwho
weighs 58. I have long black hair, brown eyes and a short nose. I can swim and I
usually ride my bicycle to school. I am quite fit and strong. In fact, I am stronger than
alotofgirls.Mysistercan’tswimbutshecanplaytennisbetterthanme.Mybrother
is crazy about football and basketball and he has pictures of football players all over
his bedroom walls.
I prefer quiet places and slow music. I am a little shy, but I am doing my best to be
open and have more friends. My brother is quite different. He is the noisiest and most
active. He likes loud music like techno and rap. He is cheerful and amusing. We all
love him for that.
My best subjects at school are languages, history and geography but I am not good at
mathsandscience.I’dliketobealawyerinthefuture. My sister is totally the opposite.
She is good at scientific subjects and she wishes to be an engineer or a doctor.
My brother, my sister and I are a little different from each other, but we are happy
together. I think we are a happy family. What about you? Tell me more about you and
your family.
Cheers,
Hasna



Dear Julia,
I’m writingthispostcardfrom
Morocco.I’m having a nice holiday
with John. The weather is
fantastic. This is our second week
here. After Fez and Rabat, here
we are in Marrakech.
John and I are happy to be in the
Red City as people call it here.
All the buildings are in red and
it’salwayssunnyandwarm. We
don’tstaymuchinthehotel.
This is our third day in
Marrakech. Today John and I are
going to visit Jamaa Lafna Square
forthesecondtime.It’savery
fascinating place, full of activity
and people. There are acrobats,
singers, dancers, snake charmers,
storytellers...
We are also going to have lunch
in the Souk (the market in the
local language). We are going to
eat a Tagine and Couscous; two
special Moroccan dishes. I am
going to buy the ingredients for
Couscous and cook some for you.
I’vegottherecipe.I’m sure
you’re going to like it.
We’re going to spend two more
days in Marrakech then go down
south to Agadir; a seaside city
famous for its warm weather and
long beaches. We are going to
come back to Liverpool next
weekend.I’m going to phone you
when I get there.
Are you having a nice time with
Peter? John and I miss you a lot!
Take care,
Ann



Come to Agadir for an unforgettable holiday!
Stay in one of the fine hotels
in Agadir.Don’t worry about
the language. A lot of people
here speak English. You can
sunbathe on the beautiful
beaches of Taghazout 20
kms far from Agadir, lie on
the golden sand or swim in the warm blue
water of the Atlantic Ocean.
The weather is usually very nice all year
long.Yes,it’s sometimes windy and cold in
March and April, but there are sports
you can practice then. Agadir is also a
good place for surfers.
But don’t spend all your time on the
beach and in sports. This is Agadir and
Agadir is also a good place for
shopping. There are hundreds of
souvenir shops. You can also visit
“SOUKLHAD”a traditional market in
the center of the city. All you need is
there and it’s a cheap
place.

partition of Palestine, he
and his family became refugees and
moved to Cairo where they lived with
relatives.

young man were reading novels and
listening to classical music. He learned to
speak several languages and to play the
piano.
He graduated form Princeton University
(USA) where he received his Masters
Degree and then attended Harvard
University (USA) where he received his
Ph.D. He then took a position in

Assistant Professor of Comparative
Literature.
When the Arab-Israeli war broke out in
1967, he began to review his career in
Comparative Literature. He began
thinking of his own identity as a
Palestinian. At this time his life changed
and he began to get involved with his
cultural origins. He became intensely
interested in literary scholarship and
Palestinian rights. He was once a member
of the Palestine National Council and a
leader in the Palestinian cause.
Edward Said wrote many
important books, like
Beginnings (1975), The
Question of Palestine
(1979), Orientalism (1980),
Literature and Society
(1980), Musical
Elaborations (1991), Out of
Place (1999), Reflections on Exile
(2000), etc. He died on Thursday,

31, children wear a special costume such
as a witch, ghost, or clown. They go to
many houses and they knock on the door
saying, "Trick or Treat!" It means that if
people don't give them a treat, they will
play some kind of trick on the household.
So, usually people give candy to them.
I carved my first Halloween pumpkin at
my Friendship Family's house. First, I cut open
the top of the pumpkin and pulled the seeds
out. 
It was not good for me because it was
sticky and smelled awful. I had never
carved a pumpkin, so it was interesting for
me. Next, I carved the eyes and the mouth. I
wanted to make a face like a pirate.
When I finished making the face, I put a
candle inside. It was very beautiful, so I
was happy.
I had a good experience because I
learned one new idea about American
culture by taking part in it. I think
Halloween is an interesting American
holiday which involves all family
members and neighbours too!



Dear Editor,
I read your article about the difference between life in the city and that in the
countryside; and I am writing to tell you and the readers why I disagree with you.
I was born in London and grew up there. I know this city very well. I also know some
countryside in England very well thanks to my job. These days I am working in the
countryside, south of England. My company sent me here a few months ago.That’s why I
believe I have an interesting opinion to give you about this topic.
Many people believe that life in the countryside is much better than in the city. Well, they
are wrong. Living in the countryside is really difficult. Last week, for example, I wanted
to go out at night but I couldn’t.There’s no where to go to enjoy oneself.Another thing is
that one of my colleagues fell sick and it was difficult to find an ambulance at night. It
took us more than three hours to get to the nearest hospital.
You also said that people in the city are not as nice as those in the countryside. This is
another wrong idea. People are the same everywhere. They are nice to you if you are nice
to them.
Another misconception is about pollution. The countryside is not wholly clean. The air we
breathe is not as fresh as you said. Did you know that many factories exist in many
villages? The authorities believe that it’s a solution to the problem of joblessness.
I hope you will publish this email in your next issue. Concerning the topic to discuss next
time,I suggest the following:“How can wemake life in the city much better?”
Sincerely yours,
James Wade.

Summer
It's a warm summer's day in the school
holidaysbuttheSmiths’childrenarenot
out playing, they are in a darkened room,
glued to the TV set, zapping aliens on
their Nintendos or surfing the Internet.
As their friends ride their bikes, go
swimming, play football and walk the
dog,theonlygamestheSmiths’children
play are those on the computer, and their
only pet is the mouse.
For thousands of
children the
computer and the
TV now dominate
their lives, turning
them into
electronic junkies
with virtual childhoods where real
relationships are replaced by artificial ones.
Many children, too, begin their TV
viewing early and finish late.
Programmes designed to entertain young
viewers begin in the early morning.
So parents may still be in bed when their
children are already up and channel
hopping.
According to an American study for the
U.S. National Institute of Education, ten
hours TV watching a week is a healthy
level and any more than that results in
under performance at school and an
unhealthy lifestyle.



More homework or not more homework!
Today, kids find that the amount of
homework they get keeps them from
playing sports, taking music lessons or
just having fun after school. A recent
study by the University of Michigan
reports that over the past 16 years, the
amount of time the average 3 to 11-yearold kid spends on homework has
increased by 50 percent. More and more
parents are protesting against so much
homework.
“Thequestion iswhetherschoolsare
holding our children captives with
homework,”saidKenKiewra,professor
of educational psychology. He realized
one day last year that his sixth-grade son
had given up music lessons, the football
team and his favourite hobby because he
was loaded down with homework. "I'm
home reading the paper and relaxing and
this kid who left in the morning before I
did is doing two to three hours of work,"
remembered Kiewra.
In response, Kiewra wrote an article for
the Lincoln newspaper. Although parents
responded favourably to his article, the
school refused to change their homework
policies. Kiewra explained that, from the
school's point of view, “Research
confirms that doing homework is better
thannotdoinghomework.”Headdedthat
pressure for students to perform well on
standardized tests has led schools to pile
on at-home assignments. All work and no
playcanmakeboringkids.“Kidsneedto
play outside and exercise or take art or

Kiewra.“Attheveryleast,theyneed

The Boy in the Moon 
An early delivery of their son catches Ian Brown and his wife Johanna Schneller by surprise. Their son Walker is born with a rare genetic disorder, which went undetected in the womb. His condition will impact everything from walking to talking to eating. And life changes, completely.



Part 2:
Walker is diagnosed with Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a condition so rare only 300 people in the world have been diagnosed with it. Ian and his wife are faced with the task of raising a boy who can’t tell them anything, and soon find themselves imagining everything. They yearn to communicate with Walker and ask him questions. What do you dream at night? What do you think about? Why do you keep hitting yourself?



Part 3:
Ian reflects on the beautiful moments — the private language of tongue clicks and the joys of an echoing hallway. He also recalls the worst moments — his wife at the bottom of the darkness, and well-meaning friends who cannot help. The family makes a decision with a profound impact; a turning point with no turning back.



Bonus episode – Interview with Ian Brown and Emil Sher:
Chris talks to playwright Emil Sher and journalist Ian Brown about Ian’s bestselling book-turned-play, The Boy in the Moon. Both tell the story of Ian’s quest to connect with his son, Walker, who was born with a rare genetic disorder. The two writers discuss the challenge of portraying Ian’s family on stage; the guilt and shame associated with disability; and why Ian had to rethink the idea of love and where to find it.

kilos of potatoes, some spring onions and get a few carrots as
well.

out of toilet paper, so get some more and pick up a few beers
for the weekend.



Paul Forrester
Hi, I’m Paul and I’m from London. I was born in South London, but
now I live in North London with my girlfriend in a small flat.
I’m a nurse in a home for the elderly, which sounds a bit strange
because not many young men choose to do this sort of work, you
know, taking care of old people.
But I really love my job. It’s not easy at times and you need a lot
of patience, especially with residents who have special needs. But
I really feel I’m helping them and that’s extremely rewarding.
I spend the whole day here, from 7am until 5pm and we all have
lunch together in the residence dining room.
I work 5 days a week, but that includes Saturdays, so can I take
Mondays off instead. I often do the shopping on Mondays and clean
the flat. My girlfriend works on Mondays. But we spend Sundays
together and we usually go hiking.



Hello is that the toy department?
Oh hello, I wonder if you can help me. I bought my son a drone for Christmas
from your shop and it doesn’t work properly. I’d like to bring it back and change
it.
Well, it starts up. You know the light goes on and the propeller starts moving
and it makes a noise, but it doesn’t get off the ground. It doesn’t move at all in
the air.
Yes, I’ve checked the batteries and I’ve tried new ones.
Yes, I’ve got the receipt. Erm….just a second I’ll check on the box. It’s the
Superflight model and the model number is MBL3752.
It cost 64.99, but I don’t want a refund, I just want to change it for one that
works!
Ok. Great. I’ll see you this afternoon then. Thanks a lot. Bye!



Tom´s Day
On Sunday, Tom gets up at 10 o'clock. Then he reads his newspaper in the kitchen. He has breakfast at 11.30 and then he telephones his mother in Scotland.
In the afternoon, at 1.00, Tom plays tennis with his sister and after that, they eat dinner in a restaurant. At 6.00, Tom swims for one hour and then he goes by bike to his brother´s house. They talk and listen to music.
Tom watches television in the evening and drinks a glass of warm milk. He goes to bed at 11.30.



My working day
My working day starts very early. From Monday to Friday I get up at half past three and I have a shower and a cup of coffee. I usually leave the house at ten past four because the car always arrives a few minutes early. I get to the studio at about five o'clock and start work. My programme Good Morning Britain starts at seven o'clock and finishes at nine o'clock. Then I leave the studio at a quarter past ten. After that, I go shopping and visit some friends. I get home at three o'clock. A woman helps me with the housework and the ironing. I read a newspaper and do some work.
Then my husband gets home at half past five in the evening and I cook dinner. We stay at home in the evening. We don't go out because I go to bed very early. We usually watch television and then I go to bed at half past eight, I'm usually asleep by nine o'clock.
I think my job is very interesting but I don't like getting up very early.



The 1990´s
In January 1990, I was at primary school and in January 2000, I was at university! I left primary school in September 1990 and went to a secondary school five kilometres from my house. I got the bus every day at 7.30am and didn't get home until 5 o'clock in the evening. What a difficult life!
My family bought a satellite TV in 1991 and a new video the next year. In 1994, my brother bought a computer and I got a bicycle the next year.
I left my school in 1997 but decided not to go to university like most people: instead, I went walking in France alone for four months and then drove around America for three months with my brother. For the first six months of 1998, I got a job in a health food shop and then went to university in October 1998 in Wales.



My name is Ben
My name is Ben and I come from Australia. I am 24 years old and I live in a small town near Sydney called Branton.
I don't have a job now, but normally I clean shop windows. I am not married but I live with my very beautiful girlfriend, Maria, in a nice house in Branton. We don't have any children - maybe next year.
My girlfriend is an actress, but she isn't very famous. She acts in a small theater in our town. At the weekend, we like to go swimming in a big lake near our house.
I normally get up at eight o'clock, but on Thursday I get up at six o'clock because that is the day when I go running in the park.
I like living in Branton because it's not too big. There are some historical buildings in the center of the town and near Branton, there is a river where I go fishing sometimes when I want to relax.



Tomas from Vienna
I'm Tomas and I live in Vienna with my parents and my sisters. I'm the youngest in my family. I turned 13 last month. My sisters are Martina, 16, and Betta, 19. Betta's very serious and she always tells me what to do, I guess because she's the oldest. I go to a nice school not too far from our home and I really enjoy it. I have a lot of friends there and I enjoy studying. My best subject is Geography, probably because it's the easiest too! My most difficult subject is Math - I'm terrible and I don't like my teacher. I love playing sports, especially basketball. I'm the tallest player on the school team and I usually play really well. It's the happiest part of my day. My coach says that one day I could play professional basketball! On the weekend I spend a lot of time with my friends Ralf and Kurt. We do everything together and they are the most important people in my life, apart from my family of course!



Tim's Day
Every day Tim wakes up at five thirty when his alarm clock rings. He gets up and then goes to the bathroom and has a long, hot shower. After that he makes breakfast for him and his wife, Betty. Tim has coffee and two slices of toast and Betty drinks a cup of tea and eats a bowl of cornflakes. At six o'clock Tim brushes his teeth, always before he gets dressed because it is very important that he doesn't get toothpaste on his clothes - Tim is a train driver and he wears a uniform! Finally, he kisses his wife and baby son and leaves his house in Watford at a quarter after six.
Tim starts work at seven o'clock and drives trains on the London Underground. He usually works in the mornings from Monday to Friday, but he sometimes works on the weekends too. At noon he stops work for half an hour to have his lunch. He eats cheese and tomato sandwiches which Betty makes for him, and drinks a bottle of milk. After lunch he works until four o'clock and then he goes home. In the evening he plays with his baby son, Ben, and watches TV with Betty. At ten thirty they all go to bed because they are very tired - and because they get up so early in the morning!
