Dear Julia,
I’m writingthispostcardfrom
Morocco.I’m having a nice holiday
with John. The weather is
fantastic. This is our second week
here. After Fez and Rabat, here
we are in Marrakech.
John and I are happy to be in the
Red City as people call it here.
All the buildings are in red and
it’salwayssunnyandwarm. We
don’tstaymuchinthehotel.
This is our third day in
Marrakech. Today John and I are
going to visit Jamaa Lafna Square
forthesecondtime.It’savery
fascinating place, full of activity
and people. There are acrobats,
singers, dancers, snake charmers,
storytellers...
We are also going to have lunch
in the Souk (the market in the
local language). We are going to
eat a Tagine and Couscous; two
special Moroccan dishes. I am
going to buy the ingredients for
Couscous and cook some for you.
I’vegottherecipe.I’m sure
you’re going to like it.
We’re going to spend two more
days in Marrakech then go down
south to Agadir; a seaside city
famous for its warm weather and
long beaches. We are going to
come back to Liverpool next
weekend.I’m going to phone you
when I get there.
Are you having a nice time with
Peter? John and I miss you a lot!
Take care,
Ann
