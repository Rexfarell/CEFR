The 1990Â´s
In January 1990, I was at primary school and in January 2000, I was at university! I left primary school in September 1990 and went to a secondary school five kilometres from my house. I got the bus every day at 7.30am and didn't get home until 5 o'clock in the evening. What a difficult life!
My family bought a satellite TV in 1991 and a new video the next year. In 1994, my brother bought a computer and I got a bicycle the next year.
I left my school in 1997 but decided not to go to university like most people: instead, I went walking in France alone for four months and then drove around America for three months with my brother. For the first six months of 1998, I got a job in a health food shop and then went to university in October 1998 in Wales.
