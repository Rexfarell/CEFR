A request from your boss
Susanne: Hi, Mario. Can you help me prepare some things for the next month?
Mario: OK, sure. What can I help you with?
Susanne: I need to visit the customer in Germany. It's important.
Mario: What can I do to help?
Susanne: Can you send an email to the customer? Ask them when I can visit them next week. Please do this first. It's a priority and very urgent.
Mario: Right. I'll do it today.
Susanne: Thanks. This next task is also important. Can you invite everyone to the next team meeting?
Mario: Yes, I will.
Susanne: But first you need to book a meeting room. After that, please send everyone an email about it.
Mario: Yes, of course.
Susanne: And finally, can you write a short report about our new project? I have to give a presentation to our managers next month. Please do it when you have time â€“ sometime in the next two or three weeks. It's not too urgent.
Mario: Sure, no problem. I can do it this week.
Susanne: There's no hurry. Take your time.
