Halloween Fun
Halloween is one of the
most famous holidays in
the U.S., and it is on
October 31. People carve
pumpkins and make funny
faces on them. These
are called "Jack-O-Lanterns." On October
31, children wear a special costume such
as a witch, ghost, or clown. They go to
many houses and they knock on the door
saying, "Trick or Treat!" It means that if
people don't give them a treat, they will
play some kind of trick on the household.
So, usually people give candy to them.
I carved my first Halloween pumpkin at
my Friendship Family's house. First, I cut open
the top of the pumpkin and pulled the seeds
out. 
It was not good for me because it was
sticky and smelled awful. I had never
carved a pumpkin, so it was interesting for
me. Next, I carved the eyes and the mouth. I
wanted to make a face like a pirate.
When I finished making the face, I put a
candle inside. It was very beautiful, so I
was happy.
I had a good experience because I
learned one new idea about American
culture by taking part in it. I think
Halloween is an interesting American
holiday which involves all family
members and neighbours too!
