A SHOPPING LIST
Here’s the list for the supermarket. We need fruit, so get some
bananas, 4 apples and some kiwis.
Also, for the vegetable stew we need 1 kilo, er… no make that 2
kilos of potatoes, some spring onions and get a few carrots as
well.
Get 2 loaves of white bread and 2 pints of milk. Oh, and your
sister likes red wine, so get a bottle of that for her. We need
some of that Spanish cheese. Mmm… that’s delicious and we’re
out of toilet paper, so get some more and pick up a few beers
for the weekend.
