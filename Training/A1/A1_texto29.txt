What’s your job?
I am actor.
When do you work?
I work at 7.00 and you? 
I work at 9.00!
Yes, it’s a very long day, but sometimes I take a break for an hour in the afternoon.
What time do you get home?
I get home at about 9.30.
Where do you have dinner?
Usually at home while I learn my lines for the next day.
Then I go to bed at 11.00.
So do you have a glamorous life?
Not when I’m at work, no – definitely not!
