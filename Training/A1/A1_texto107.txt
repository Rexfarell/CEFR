Paul Forrester
Hi, I’m Paul and I’m from London. I was born in South London, but
now I live in North London with my girlfriend in a small flat.
I’m a nurse in a home for the elderly, which sounds a bit strange
because not many young men choose to do this sort of work, you
know, taking care of old people.
But I really love my job. It’s not easy at times and you need a lot
of patience, especially with residents who have special needs. But
I really feel I’m helping them and that’s extremely rewarding.
I spend the whole day here, from 7am until 5pm and we all have
lunch together in the residence dining room.
I work 5 days a week, but that includes Saturdays, so can I take
Mondays off instead. I often do the shopping on Mondays and clean
the flat. My girlfriend works on Mondays. But we spend Sundays
together and we usually go hiking.
