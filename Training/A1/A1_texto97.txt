Dear Editor,
I read your article about the difference between life in the city and that in the
countryside; and I am writing to tell you and the readers why I disagree with you.
I was born in London and grew up there. I know this city very well. I also know some
countryside in England very well thanks to my job. These days I am working in the
countryside, south of England. My company sent me here a few months ago.That’s why I
believe I have an interesting opinion to give you about this topic.
Many people believe that life in the countryside is much better than in the city. Well, they
are wrong. Living in the countryside is really difficult. Last week, for example, I wanted
to go out at night but I couldn’t.There’s no where to go to enjoy oneself.Another thing is
that one of my colleagues fell sick and it was difficult to find an ambulance at night. It
took us more than three hours to get to the nearest hospital.
You also said that people in the city are not as nice as those in the countryside. This is
another wrong idea. People are the same everywhere. They are nice to you if you are nice
to them.
Another misconception is about pollution. The countryside is not wholly clean. The air we
breathe is not as fresh as you said. Did you know that many factories exist in many
villages? The authorities believe that it’s a solution to the problem of joblessness.
I hope you will publish this email in your next issue. Concerning the topic to discuss next
time,I suggest the following:“How can wemake life in the city much better?”
Sincerely yours,
James Wade.
