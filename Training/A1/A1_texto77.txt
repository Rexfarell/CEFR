The Weather
It’s the weekend and Jim has no homework to do. It’s
time to wake up and check the weather for the week.
There’s a storm today. It will not last long. There will
be a storm and it will rain on Saturday. On Sunday, the
temperature will drop and there will be snow. What
about Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday? Will it be cloudy, fair or wet? Jim has clothes
for every kind of weather. Monkey is already dressed up
to go outside
