My office
Like most offices, my office is a place where I can concentrate on my work and feel comfortable at the same time.
Of course, I have all the necessary equipment on my desk. I have the telephone next to the fax machine on the right side of my desk. My computer is in the center of my desk with the monitor directly in front of me.
I have a comfortable office chair to sit on and some pictures of my family between the computer and the telephone.
In order to help me read, I also have a lamp near my computer which I use in the evening if I work late.
There is plenty of paper in one of the cabinet drawers. There are also staples and a stapler, paper clips, highlighters, pens and erasers in the other drawer.
In the room, there is a comfortable armchair and a sofa to sit on. I also have a low table in front of the sofa on which there are some industry magazines.
