The library
Student: Hi. Excuse me.
Student B: Yes?
Student: Where's the library?
Student B: The library? It's next to the registration office.
Student: Ah ... sorry, I'm new. Where's the registration office?
Student B: No problem. See the big building over there?
Student: Yes.
Student B: OK, so that's the lecture theatre. Next to that, on the right, is the registration office. And next to that is the library.
Student: I see. Thanks!
