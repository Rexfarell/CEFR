Carnival of Barranquilla
Carnival is one of the most traditional
Colombian folklore celebrations.
Dance groups, costume makers, and
the Queen of the Carnival work very
hard to make it an unforgettable party.
We celebrate carnival for four days.
On Saturday, we see ‘The Battle of
Flowers’, a parade of dance groups
and floats.
On Sunday, we see ‘La Gran Parada de
Tradición’ and the ‘Orchestra Festival’.
On Monday, ‘the Gran Parada de
Comparsas’ shows fantasy costumes
and dancing.
Carnival ends on Tuesday with The
Burial of Joselito, who symbolizes the
joy of the Barranquilla Carnival.
