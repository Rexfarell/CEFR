Pedro's House
Pedro is from Portugal. He lives
with his parents in Lisbon in an old
house by the sea. The house is not
big but he likes it very much.
There are three bedrooms upstairs;
one for his parents, one for his
sister and one for him. The
bathroom and the living room are
downstairs. In the living room there
is a lovely fireplace. Next to the
living room is the kitchen. The
kitchen is not modern but they have
a new washing machine.
In the evening, all the family sit in
the living room to watch TV and
have dinner. At the back of the
house there is a small but very
beautiful garden with different
plants and flowers. His father likes
to spend his free time there.
Pedro likes to spend most of his
time at home in his bedroom.It’s
also his study room where he has a
desk and a stereo. He loves his room
because he can see the sea from
the window.It’s a fantastic view.
