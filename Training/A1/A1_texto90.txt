Dear mom and dad,
Well I want to tell you about my first
week of classes at the University. I get
up at 6:00 every morning. That is really
early for me. I don't like to get up early
you know. I usually eat breakfast in the
school cafeteria. The food here is
pretty good. I have German class every
morning at 7:30. After German class I
have Business and Economics on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at 10:00. I have
a lot of homework in that class but I
really like it. I also have English
Composition on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I
have United States History.
The campus here is really big. After
some problems during the first days, I
now know where all the buildings and
classrooms are. My dormitory is close so
I walk to all my classes.
My roommate's name is Eric. He is from
Los Angeles. We are good friends now.
He is quiet and doesn't make a lot of
noise. Sometimes Eric and I have dinner
together. We don't see each other
much because our school programmes
are really different.
During the evening I study. Sometimes I
study in the library and sometimes in
the dormitory. I usually go to bed
around eleven.
Mom, I sure miss your
cooking. Could you
send me some of your
homemade chocolate
cookies? Well, I have
to go. Take care.
Love,
Jerry
