More homework or not more homework!
Today, kids find that the amount of
homework they get keeps them from
playing sports, taking music lessons or
just having fun after school. A recent
study by the University of Michigan
reports that over the past 16 years, the
amount of time the average 3 to 11-yearold kid spends on homework has
increased by 50 percent. More and more
parents are protesting against so much
homework.
“Thequestion iswhetherschoolsare
holding our children captives with
homework,”saidKenKiewra,professor
of educational psychology. He realized
one day last year that his sixth-grade son
had given up music lessons, the football
team and his favourite hobby because he
was loaded down with homework. "I'm
home reading the paper and relaxing and
this kid who left in the morning before I
did is doing two to three hours of work,"
remembered Kiewra.
In response, Kiewra wrote an article for
the Lincoln newspaper. Although parents
responded favourably to his article, the
school refused to change their homework
policies. Kiewra explained that, from the
school's point of view, “Research
confirms that doing homework is better
thannotdoinghomework.”Headdedthat
pressure for students to perform well on
standardized tests has led schools to pile
on at-home assignments. All work and no
playcanmakeboringkids.“Kidsneedto
