At the doctor´s
The doctor is very busy today. Some of the
Movers look terrible. The doctor has got to help
with a bad cough, a cold, a stomach-ache, a
headache, an earache, a bad back and a hurt
shoulder. He isn’t sure who he should see first.
He wishes everyone would stop shouting! The
nurse will help – after she’s finished drinking her
cup of tea!
