Organising a group project
Cara: So for our group project, do you want to start this week?
Selim: Yeah, I want to start early so we have enough time.
Robert: Me too, but I've got a big maths project too.
Cara: How about we meet first to plan what we're going to do? Just for an hour.
Robert: Good idea, Cara.
Cara: When are you free?
Robert: I can always do mornings before 10.
Cara: Robert … Uh …
Selim: I'm sleeping before 10!
Robert: OK! OK, so when are you two free?
Cara: Wednesdays are good for me. But not very early, please!
Selim: I can't do the mornings on Wednesdays but I have 3 till 5 free.
Robert: I can do 4 o'clock, just before my maths class.
Cara: Great, 4 then. Where shall we meet?
Selim: The library?
Robert: I don't know. The library isn't a good place for a planning meeting as we can't talk in there.
Cara: How about the university café? It's near the library. We can talk in there. And eat cake.
Selim: Cake is good.
Robert: OK, so Wednesday at the café. I need to leave at ten to five to go to my maths class.
Cara: No problem. Planning will take less than an hour.
Selim: OK! See you Wednesday for cake.
Robert and Cara: See you, Selim!
