Come to Agadir for an unforgettable holiday!
Stay in one of the fine hotels
in Agadir.Don’t worry about
the language. A lot of people
here speak English. You can
sunbathe on the beautiful
beaches of Taghazout 20
kms far from Agadir, lie on
the golden sand or swim in the warm blue
water of the Atlantic Ocean.
The weather is usually very nice all year
long.Yes,it’s sometimes windy and cold in
March and April, but there are sports
you can practice then. Agadir is also a
good place for surfers.
But don’t spend all your time on the
beach and in sports. This is Agadir and
Agadir is also a good place for
shopping. There are hundreds of
souvenir shops. You can also visit
“SOUKLHAD”a traditional market in
the center of the city. All you need is
there and it’s a cheap
place.
