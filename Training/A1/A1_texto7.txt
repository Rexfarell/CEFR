Alfred's daily routine
Alfred is an American boy. He lives in Los Angeles, California. He lives with his family in a modern house. He is eleven years old and he has got an older brother, David, and a younger sister, Emma.
He starts his day at about half past seven. He gets up, goes to the bathroom, takes a shower, brushes his teeth and get dressed. Then he has breakfast and at a quarter to eight he leaves home and catches the bus to school.
Classes begin at half past eight. He usually has lunch at the school canteen at half past twelve. After school, at a quarter past five, he goes home. There he does his school homework and when he finishes it he helps his Mum laying the table. At half past seven the family dines together.
Alfred is a very helpful boy, so he helps his mother cleaning up everything after dinner.
He usually watches TV for a while after dinner and at about ten oâ€™clock the most he brushes his teeth again, puts on his Spider Man pajamas and goes to bed. His parents always kiss him good night before he gets asleep. Alfred is a very happy boy!
