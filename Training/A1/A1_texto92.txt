Hi Andrew,
Nice to hear from you. Replying to your email, here is some information about my
family and me. I am from Tangier, north of Morocco. I have a sister and a brother:
Leila 14 and Jamal 11. I am 16 years old. My father is a fireman and my mother is a
nurse. We live in a small but nice house by the sea.
I am taller than my mother and I weigh 54 kilos. That’slessthanmysisterwho
weighs 58. I have long black hair, brown eyes and a short nose. I can swim and I
usually ride my bicycle to school. I am quite fit and strong. In fact, I am stronger than
alotofgirls.Mysistercan’tswimbutshecanplaytennisbetterthanme.Mybrother
is crazy about football and basketball and he has pictures of football players all over
his bedroom walls.
I prefer quiet places and slow music. I am a little shy, but I am doing my best to be
open and have more friends. My brother is quite different. He is the noisiest and most
active. He likes loud music like techno and rap. He is cheerful and amusing. We all
love him for that.
My best subjects at school are languages, history and geography but I am not good at
mathsandscience.I’dliketobealawyerinthefuture. My sister is totally the opposite.
She is good at scientific subjects and she wishes to be an engineer or a doctor.
My brother, my sister and I are a little different from each other, but we are happy
together. I think we are a happy family. What about you? Tell me more about you and
your family.
Cheers,
Hasna
