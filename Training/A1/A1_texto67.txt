Inviting someone to the cinema
Jack: Hi, Ismael. How are you?
Ismael: Hi, Jack. I'm OK but I’ve got loads of homework.
Jack: Me too, but would you like to come with us to the cinema tonight?
Ismael: Who's 'us'?
Jack: Me, Jamie, Nicola and Selina.
Ismael: OK, and what's the film?
Jack: We don't know. We can't decide. There's that new horror film, 'Light and Dark'.
Ismael: No, no, no! I don't like horror films.
Jack: OK, well, there's a comedy about a school.
Ismael: Oh, no more school, please! What about a romcom?
Jack: Romcom?
Ismael: You know, romantic comedy, boy meets girl ...
Jack: What? Really? No, I hate romantic films. I like action.
Ismael: Well, there's a new science fiction film, 'Alien attacks'.
Jack: OK, I like science fiction. Let's see that.
Ismael: OK, I'll ask the others if they like sci-fi.
Jack: What time is the film?
Ismael: At 8 o'clock. Let’s meet at 7:30 outside the cinema.
Jack: OK. See you later.
Ismael: Bye.
