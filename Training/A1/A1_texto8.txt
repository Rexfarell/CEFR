My name is Annie and this is what I normally do. I love to walk on the mountain.
During the week, I wake up early and go for a small walk on the mountain.  I usually go with my father or my brother.  We like to get some fresh air before we start our day.
We live in a country far away from the city.  We think that our countryâ€™s life is wonderful because we are away from the noise and pollution of the city.
We often walk for about one-half hour and then return to our home.  I always take my bus after our walk at about 8:30 a.m. and arrive at school at 9:00 a.m.
My father takes his car and goes to town to work.  He works at a veterinary clinic.  He is a vet and loves to help animals.  We have 3 dogs and two cats.
On the weekend we wake up early and go for a hike on the mountain.  It is so nice to smell the fresh air and see the wild animals. We stay there for about three hours and bring our lunch with us.  As you can see my family loves nature.
