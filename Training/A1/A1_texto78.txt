Our Town
The Movers go into the busy town centre.
The market arrived yesterday and will stay
until tomorrow. It’s a great place to buy some
fresh vegetables for a healthy salad. Opposite
the market there is a library. If you go out of
the town square you will find ice creams near
the library. There’s always lots to see and do in
town. It’s never boring
