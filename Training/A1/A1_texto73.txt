A favorite toy shop
Here is the village toy shop. The Movers
are shopping for their favourite toys. There
are lots of different toys for everyone – fat
teddy bears, funny comic books. Pretty
Polly, the naughty parrot, is eating the
pirate’s beard. ‘Get off’ shouts the surprised
pirate. Come on in. Come inside and have a
good look around.
