My Art Class
One of the things I like best about school is my art class. We have a great teacher named Mrs. Hilbert. She is a wonderful artist.
I love to watch her draw and paint. She taught us how to mix paint to make just the right colors for our paintings. She plays good music while we draw and paint.
We draw and paint almost everyday in class. Some days we look at pictures of other artists. It is interesting to do this. It helps me to think of things that I want to paint or draw.
We have an art exhibit in May this year. Our work will be in one of the banks in our town. We are inviting people from the community to our exhibit. Our parents are invited to go with us.
I have three paintings I am working on now. I hope one of them will be chosen to be in the exhibit. I like having a goal to work toward.
