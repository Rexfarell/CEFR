Lupita's Day
Hello. My name is Lupita Gonzalez. I
work in a large company in
Monterrey, Mexico. We make
bottles and cans for soft drinks. I
am a secretary. I answer the
telephone and take messages. I also
use a fax machine and a computer.
My first language is Spanish but
sometimes I speak English. Many of
our clients are from the United
States. My supervisor is Mr.
Torres. He is an engineer. I start
work at 8:00. I usually drive to
work. I have lunch from 1:00 to 2:00. I finish work at 5:30. I go
home and help my mother prepare
dinner. We have dinner at 9:00.
After dinner I usually watch
television a while. I usually go to
bed at 11:00.
