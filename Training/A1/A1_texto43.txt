In the Restaurant
Staff: Hello, Gino's.
Jamie: Hi, I called earlier to book a table for four and I was wondering if I can make it for six instead?
Staff: Ah, what name was it?
Jamie: It's Jamie.
Staff: Table for four at half past seven. So you want to change it to 6 o'clock?
Jamie: No, sorry. Can I make it for six people?
Staff: Oh, I see. Sorry! That shouldn't be a problem. I can move you to a bigger table but it will be nearer the kitchen. Is that OK?
Jamie: No problem. Is it possible to change the time as well? Make it a little bit later?
Staff: Ah ... yeah, we can. Is eight OK for you?
Jamie: Perfect, thanks!
Staff: Lovely. See you tomorrow, then.
Jamie: Thanks! Bye!
Staff: Thanks. Ciao!
