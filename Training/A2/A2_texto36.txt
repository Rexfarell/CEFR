Madagascar- When to go
Madagascar has two seasons, a warm, wet season from November to April, and a cooler dry season between May and October. However, different parts of the country have very different weather.
The east coast is hotter and wetter, with up to 4000mm of rainfall per year. In the rainy season, there are strong winds, and these can cause a lot of damage.  Avoid visiting eastern Madagascar between January and March because the weather can make road travel very difficult.  The dry season is cooler and more pleasant.
The high, central part of the country is much drier and cooler. About 1,400 mm of rain falls in the rainy season, with some thunderstorms, but the summer is usually sunny and dry, but it can be cold, especially in the mornings, with freezing showers, and it may snow in mountain areas above 2,400m, and even stay there for several days.
The west coast is the driest part of the island. Here, the winter months are pleasant with little rain, cooler temperatures and blue skies.  The summers can be extremely hot, especially in the southwest.  This part of the country is semi-desert, and only gets around 300mm of rain per year.
