Being and Adult
I used to think that I'd know I was an adult when I got married, bought a home and had children.
However, high house prices, and the desire to marry only when both partners have permanent, secure jobs means that for many people these events now come later in their lives
than they might once have done. Just because at this point, I have none of above, it doesn´t mean that I haven't grow up,
In fact, the 2014 Clark Established Adult Poll found that people on my generation now see financial independence and making our own decisions as the evidence that we are grown-up.
Modern life gives those in their 20's more time to "find themselves" before they settle down.  This is a period that is unknown in traditional societies, where people get married earlier.
It has led to some researchers labelling them the "me generation". They believe that this focus on the individual is bad for democracy and for society.
However, Erica Bourne, a social scientist, says about contemporary young people " It´s true that they are not as interested in politics, but all data shows that they are interested 
in social change and finding creative ways to make a difference".
