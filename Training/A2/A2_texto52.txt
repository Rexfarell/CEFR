Hi! How are you?
Thanks for the e-mail. Sorry for not answering sooner. I’ve just come back from
Angra Dos Reis, Brazil, with Maria. I’m very tired because we couldn’t get a direct flight back. We left from
JFK airport at six o’clock this morning! We had the most wonderful time in Brazil. We stayed at the Green
Park Hotel, which is about six kilometres from the town. It was very comfortable and good value for
money. I can definitely recommend it. The weather was great – very hot and the people were superb. The
only problem was the food. There wasn’t much variety and I got bored eating the same things every day.
The first week we spent in the gym and on the beach. Then Maria’s parents came for the second week.
All the best.
 Tony
