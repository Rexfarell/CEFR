Are you free this afternoon? Do you want to go out?

I just have to finish my homework, but I think I can finish it this morning. What do you want to do?

Let’s go into town. We can go shopping and then get a coffee. We can go to the new cafe near the library.  The cakes look great there.

You know I hate shopping. Why don’t we go to the park?  Kev and Rob will be there skateboarding.  We can have meet up with them.

I don’t want to spend my Saturday afternoon watching boys skateboarding! That’s so boring!  But we can go to the park for a game of tennis if you like.

I’m not really in the mood for tennis.  I don’t want to do anything too active. I want to just relax.  You could come to my house, and we could watch a movie.  We’ve got lots of good food.

I could watch a film on my own.  Why don’t I bring some board games round?  That’ll be a bit more fun.

Okay, that sounds alright, but my little brother will probably want to play too.  Is that okay with you?

Sure.  Shall I invite anyone else?  I think Sophie is free this afternoon.

Okay, you can invite her, but no-one else.  I don’t want too many people round.

Fine. I’ll come round after lunch.  Is one o’clock okay?
