Young blog writers
Tasha
Last year I wrote for my college magazine, which I found really difficult, but I
don’t think it’s hard to write a good blog. Mine is about things from daily life
that make me laugh. My older brother also has a blog, but we’re writing about
different subjects. We don’t discuss what we’re planning, but we read each
other’s blogs sometimes. I like giving advice to people who write in asking for
it – it’s good to know I’ve helped.

I started writing my popular film blog because I love movies. I like it when
readers send me articles by email about a film they’ve seen, and I put these on
my blog for everyone to read. I’m still at college, so I’m careful about spending
too long on my blog, which is difficult as writing well takes time. I don’t think I’ll
write it for much longer. I’m busy, and it’s time to do something new.

I began writing on a school magazine. I stopped after a few years, but I missed
it, so I started my own – I’m still writing it now! The blog’s new for me, and I write
about daily life. I get ideas from friends or my sister when I can’t decide what to
write about – we always think of something interesting, sad or serious. At first,
almost nobody visited my site, but now more do, I’ve had some lovely
comments
