Bill Clinton caught in snow in Austria
Former US President Bill Clinton met model
Naomi Campbell on a snow-covered mountain in Austria. Naomiâ€™s flight arrived late
because of the bad weather and she nearly fell
down getting through the snow. Bill Clinton
helped her through the snow and they chatted
for a while about the weather. Naomi Campbell was doing a photo session at the same
place where Clinton was at a conference.
