A family of dancers
The women in the Watson family are all crazy about ballet. These
days, Alice Watson gives ballet lessons, but for many years, she was
a dancer with the National Ballet Company. Her mother, Hannah, also
had a full-time job there, making costumes for the dancers.
Alice’s daughter Demi started learning ballet as soon as she could
walk. ‘I never taught her,’ says Alice, ‘because she never let me.’ Now
aged sixteen, Demi is a member of the ballet company where her
mother was the star dancer for many years.
Alice’s husband, Jack, is an electrician. They met while he was working at a theatre where she was
dancing and got married soon after. ‘When Demi started dancing, the house was too small for her
and Alice to practise in so I made the garage into a dance studio. Now the living room is nice and
quiet when I’m watching television!’ he says.
Last month, Demi was invited to dance in the ballet Swan Lake. Of course, Alice and Hannah were
in the audience and even Jack was there, which made it very special for Demi. Jack says, ‘I’m not
that interested in ballet myself but it’s fantastic seeing Demi taking her first steps with Alice’s old
company!’ Demi was wearing a dress that Hannah made for Alice many years before.
‘It was very exciting for all of us,’ says Hannah. ‘Demi’s way of dancing is very like Alice’s. I know I’m
her grandmother, but I think she has a great future!’
