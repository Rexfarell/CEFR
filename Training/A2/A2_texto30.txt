Hi Ellie,
I’m so pleased you can come surfing in August! Paul, Rose and Kevin are coming too, so there will be five of us.  We’ve decided to return to New Sands, because the surf board hire is so cheap there. 
I’m starting to think about accommodation. We won’t camp again after last year! I hated staying in a tent in all that rain!
Kevin wants to hire a caravan. There are some nice ones with 3 bedrooms, showers and cooking facilities. The problem is, none of the caravan parks take short bookings in the summer. The minimum stay is a week. It’s a shame because there are several nice parks near the beach.
There’s a youth hostel in New Sands. It’s the cheapest option after camping, and there’s a big kitchen and dining room where we can cook. The problem is, accommodation is in dormitories and I don’t really want to sleep with strangers. 
There are a few guest houses in New Sands. Some have triple rooms, so we’d only need to book two rooms. They’re not expensive, but we wouldn’t be able to cook there. We’d have to eat out at restaurants, or eat sandwiches for every meal!  We’ll have to book soon if we choose that option, because many guest houses are already full. The hotels in New Sands are far too expensive, even though I’d love to stay at the Sunrise Pavilion with its rooftop pool!
The final option is to rent a cottage. Few cottages offer mid-week breaks in summer, but I found one. It has three bedrooms - a double, a single and a twin, so two of us would have to share a bed!  There’s a big kitchen diner with a microwave, washing machine and dishwasher. The living room has a TV and DVD player. There’s just one bathroom, but there’s a separate WC.  There’s a nice garden too. The problem is, it’s 5 miles from the beach, so we’d have to hire a car, because there aren’t any buses.
Let me know which option you prefer.
Cheers
Natalie
