Footballer wants to help children
Footballer Roman Gregory has started a UNICEF
campaign to help children hurt in accidents with
land mines, in countries at war and in peace. The
footballer says he cannot imagine being without
an arm or a leg and knows that many people do
not even think about what the children who have
had such injuries go through. “Many accidents
with land mines happen when children are just
playing happily in the fields”, says Roman, who
hopes to get £1 million in the campaign.
