Living in the UK
Madeleine came from Dakar to London five years ago. In the beginning she missed everything â€“ the weather, the food, her family. But now she owns a profitable business with her two sisters and her brother. They run a pound shop in London's West End. Madeleine's boyfriend is now her husband, and they have three children who go to British schools. When asked why she came to England, Madeleine says immediately, 'Because I'd like to work hard and be successful.' She definitely works hard. She's at the shop all day, then she works as a senior care assistant in the evening. 'That's why I love England,' she says.' You can be whatever you want to be. ''When I first came to England, I didn't speak the language, and it was autumn. It was so cold and rainy! Now almost all my family are here, not only in London, but also in Scotland, and in Wales. We meet about twice a year and have a huge Senegalese meal that takes about three hours! We're all happy here."
