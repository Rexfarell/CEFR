Hi Luke,
It's the semi-final on Saturday. Chelsea are playing against Arsenal and I really want to go and see the match. My brother said he can take me and a friend to watch it. Would you like to come with us? It'll be great! We can get chips and a Pepsi and watch the match and have fun. Can you call me on Thursday afternoon, because we have to buy the tickets? If you want to come, we'll come over to your house to pick you up.
Bye for now,
Jimmy
