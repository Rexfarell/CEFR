Tamara
Something very strange happened to Tamara. She never knew she had a twin sister until she started university!
Tamara was born in Mexico. Her parents could not look after her so she went to live with a family in Manhattan, USA.
When Tamara was twenty years old, she started university in Long Island. She enjoyed her university life. But one day she was walking home from class, and a student smiled at her. “Hello Adriana!” said the student. “I’m not Adriana,” said Tamara.
This happened to Tamara again and again. People Tamara didn’t know kept calling her Adriana. It was very strange. One day, when a woman called her Adriana, Tamara asked “Why do you keep calling me Adriana?”
The woman replied, “You look like my friend Adriana. You have the same face and the same hair. Is Adriana your sister?” Tamara said that she did not have a sister called Adriana. But she was interested in this girl Adriana. Finally she asked someone for Adriana’s email address.
When Tamara wrote to Adriana, she found out that they both had the same birthday, they looked the same and both of them were from Mexico.When Tamara went to live with the family in Manhattan, Adriana moved to Long Island to live with a family there. It had to be true! Adriana and Tamara were twin sisters!
