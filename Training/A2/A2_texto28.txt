Travel to England
Last summer, Joel and Sara traveled to England for two weeks. They traveled in August and stayed in a college with other students in Brighton, the South of England.
It was fantastic, because they talked to a lot of students from different nationalities and learned a lot about other cultures and customs. Of course, they learned a lot of English too because they practiced it every day.
In the morning they studied a little, they asked the teacher to speak slowly when necessary and answered her questions. In the afternoon, they visited different places and played different sports at the college.
It was so much fun. They often walked down to the beach with their new friends and played or chatted. In the evening, they were tired so they sometimes watched videos or played board games.
The best days were Saturday and Sunday because they traveled to London. The city is very big and they visited all the monuments like Big Ben, The London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. They wanted to see the Queen but they didnâ€™t see her, only her guards!
They liked everything in the city but their favorite thing was the museums, especially Madam Tussards. There were lots of realistic figures of famous people there.
At the end of the two weeks, they were sad to return home. The holidays were fun and different from the usual. They cried a little when they waved goodbye to their new friends and promised to write or send emails when they arrived home.
