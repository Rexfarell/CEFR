Kevin and Maria
Kevin:  Is that your sister - the girl over there?
Maria:  Yes, that’s my sister Catherine. How did you know?
Kevin:  You look similar.
Maria:  Do you think so?
Kevin:  Yes, I mean, obviously you have different hair. Hers is blonde, yours is brown.
Maria:  And Catherine’s isn’t curly, like mine.
Kevin:  No, but your faces are the same.
Maria:  I don’t think so. Her eyes are a different colour to mine. Hers are blue, mine are green.
Kevin:  I’m not talking about eye colour.  I mean, the shape of your faces. Her face is longer than yours, yes, but you have the same mouths, and the same noses.
Maria:  I don’t think I look like her. She’s much slimmer than me.
Kevin:  Maybe, but she isn’t any taller.
Maria:  No.
Kevin:  Are your personalities the same?
Maria:  No! We’re nothing like each other!  Catherine’s much more outgoing than me. She has lots of friends. I’m quieter.  I prefer my own company. She’s bossier too. I suppose it’s because she’s older than me.
Kevin:  You must have some things in common.
Maria:  Well, we both like music, and the countryside, and we’re both independent.  I suppose we have those things in common. What about you? Do you have a brother or a sister…?
