Free Time
Richard: Hey Molly, do you want to meet up this weekend and do something?
Molly: Er yeah, okay, what do you want to do?
Richard: You know, play some computer games, watch a DVD, maybe…
Molly: I don’t want to watch a DVD, but we can play some computer games. But I’m a bit busy. I can’t do Saturday evening. I’m going to the cinema with my sister.
Richard: I can’t do Saturday evening.  I’m going to a football match. I’ll be home late. Are you free in the morning?
Molly: No, sorry. I’m going swimming first of all. Then I need to go to the library in the afternoon. I want to get some more books to read.
Richard: Yes, I really need to go shopping. I need some more shirts. I really hate it. But I have to do it. Sunday then?
Molly: I’m going running with the running club in the morning. And I promised to help my dad with the gardening in the afternoon. But maybe after four o’clock?
Richard: I usually play squash with my flatmate about then, how about in the evening - about six thirty?
Molly: Sounds good. Do you want to come to my place?  My parents won’t be home. They’re going to a concert. And my sister goes to the sports centre on Sundays.
Richard: Aerobics?
Molly: No, she does aerobics on Wednesdays. She does yoga on Sundays … and Karate on Mondays.
Richard: That’s far too much exercise!
Molly: Well, she likes to keep fit. So Sunday evening then?
Richard: Yeah, sure. Sounds good! I’ll bring some computer games round.
Molly: My mum is going to do some baking tomorrow, so there’ll be some cakes in the house.
Richard: Brilliant. See you Sunday then.
