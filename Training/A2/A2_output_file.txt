A great summer vacation
I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasn’t even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. I was always interested in art, so that was a special treat for me. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there. Henry got tired walking around the museum and said “Enough! I need to take a break and rest.”
We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes along the river Seine. The French food we ate was delicious. The wines were tasty, too. Steve’s favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. He said he would be happy if he could eat croissants like those forever. We had so much fun that we’re already talking about our next vacation!



At school
Lucas goes to school every day of the week. He has many subjects to go to each school day: English, art, science, mathematics, gym, and history. His mother packs a big backpack full of books and lunch for Lucas.
His first class is English, and he likes that teacher very much. His English teacher says that he is a good pupil, which Lucas knows means that she thinks he is a good student.
His next class is art. He draws on paper with crayons and pencils and sometimes uses a ruler. Lucas likes art. It is his favorite class.
His third class is science. This class is very hard for Lucas to figure out, but he gets to work with his classmates a lot, which he likes to do. His friend, Kyle, works with Lucas in science class, and they have fun.
Then Lucas gets his break for lunch. He sits with Kyle while he eats. The principal, or the headmaster as some call him, likes to walk around and talk to students during lunch to check that they are all behaving.
The next class is mathematics, which most of the students just call math. Kyle has trouble getting a good grade in mathematics, but the teacher is very nice and helpful.
His fourth class is gym. It is just exercising.
History is his last class of the day Lucas has a hard time staying awake. Many lessons are boring, and he is very tired after doing gym.



Days of the week
There are seven days of the week, or uniquely named 24-hour periods designed to provide scheduling context and make time more easily measureable. Each of these days is identifiable by specific plans, moods, and tones.
Monday is viewed by many to be the "worst" day of the week, as it marks the return to work following the weekend, when most full-time employees are given two days off. Most students attend school in the morning and return home in the afternoon (usually from about eight until three or seven until two), and most workers go to work in the morning and return home in the evening (usually from nine to five or eight to four).
Tuesday is the second day of the week, and is in many ways similar to Monday. Not a whole lot changes, schedule-wise, between Tuesday and Monday; most individuals go to school or work and return home to watch television, play video games, make plans with friends, spend time with family, read, or engage in a similar leisure-related activity.
Wednesday is the third day of the week, and serves as the "middle" of the work week; some individuals refer to Wednesday as "hump day," as once its workday is complete, employees will have passed the work-week "hump," and will be on the downturn, as only two days on the job will remain in the week.
Thursday is the fourth day of the week, and is viewed favorably by many, as it's rather close to the end of the work week.
Friday is the fifth day of the week, and marks the end of the workweek and school-week for the vast majority of employees and students. By Friday afternoon/evening, most students/workers cannot wait to leave and go home, as they won't have to report back to school/work until Monday.
Saturday is perhaps the most highly regarded day of the week. Because Sunday follows it (and there is presumably no work or school to attend, for most individuals), everyone is free to stay out (or awake) until late at night, having fun with plans or other leisure-related activities. To be sure, Saturday is generally thought of as a day to partake in hobbies that couldn't otherwise be enjoyed during the regular week.
Sunday is the final day of the week, and is used by most as a day of rest. Fewer late-night plans are made on Sundays, compared to Saturdays, as most individuals have to wake up for work or school on Monday morning.



Dinner Preparation
Montie's mother was coming to dinner, so he decided to get out the beautiful dishes she gave him. He looked forward to impressing his mother. He remembered how great he felt when she gave him the dishes. First, he got out his best silverware, cups and plates.
He carefully placed the plates on the table. Then, he laid a cloth napkin next to each plate. On the left side of the plate, he placed a knife making sure that its blade was facing toward the plate. On the right side, Montie placed the fork and spoon. After filling the glasses with ice, he put water in each glass. He placed white flowers in a vase in the middle of the table. They had a beautiful aroma.
As Montie stood back to admire his work, the doorbell rang. Montie had finished just in time because his mother had arrived.



Food
While eating at a restaurant is an enjoyable and convenient occasional treat, most individuals and families prepare their meals at home. To make breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, these persons must have the required foods and ingredients on hand and ready to go; foods and ingredients are typically purchased from a grocery store, or an establishment that distributes foods, drinks, household products, and other items that're used by the typical consumer.
Produce, or the term used to describe fresh fruits and vegetables, is commonly purchased by grocery store shoppers. In terms of fruit, most grocery stores offer bananas, apples, oranges, blackberries, raspberries, grapes, pineapples, cantaloupes, watermelons, and more; other grocery stores with larger produce selections might offer the listed fruits in addition to less common fruits, including mangoes, honeydews, starfruits, coconuts, and more.
Depending on the grocery store, customers can purchase fruits in a few different ways. Some stores will charge a set amount per pound of fruit, and will weigh customers' fruit purchases and bill them accordingly; other stores will charge customers for each piece of fruit they buy, or for bundles of fruit (a bag of bananas, a bag of apples, etc.); other stores yet will simply charge by the container.
Vegetables, including lettuce, corn, tomatoes, onions, celery, cucumbers, mushrooms, and more are also sold at many grocery stores, and are purchased similarly to the way that fruits are. Grocery stores typically stock more vegetables than fruit at any given time, as vegetables remain fresh longer than fruits do, generally speaking.
It'd take quite a while to list everything else that today's massive grocery stores sell, but most customers take the opportunity to shop for staples, or foods that play a prominent role in the average diet, at the establishments. Staples include pasta, rice, flour, sugar, milk, meat, and eggs, and bread. All the listed staples are available in prepackaged containers, but can be purchased "fresh" in some grocery stores, wherein employees will measure and weigh fresh products and then provide them to customers.



Doctor
Doctor Klein: Good morning, Cecilia, how are you feeling today?
Cecilia: I do not feel very well, Doctor Klein. I hope that you can treat my illness.
Doctor Klein: I’m sorry that you feel very sick. Tell me some of your symptoms so that I can give you a proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: I have not felt well since yesterday afternoon. The symptoms began with a headache and a gradual sore throat. I drank tea with lemon and honey, and I went to bed early. However, I am extremely exhausted, and I don’t feel any better today.
Doctor Klein: I have seen these symptoms recently in some of my other patients. I’ll check your temperature and examine your throat in order to give you a proper diagnosis.
Cecilia: Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor Klein: Open up and say “Ahhhhhh...”
Cecilia: “Ahhhhhh...”
Doctor Klein: Oh, my! I can already see that your throat is very red. Your temperature of 100 degrees indicates that you are running a mild fever. I am afraid that you might have the flu.
Cecilia: What is the best way to cure my symptoms?
Doctor Klein: You will need plenty of rest, and you should drink fluids frequently in order to stay hydrated. You’ve also just started to show symptoms, so I can prescribe you a medication that can reduce fever and shorten the duration of your illness.
Cecilia: Should I stay home from work as well?
Doctor Klein: Yes, you should remain in bed until the fever breaks. You should also wait until 24 hours after the fever has broken before you return to work. You do not want to risk getting your coworkers sick as well.
Cecilia: I suppose I will just take it easy and relax for a couple of days. Thank you, doctor, for all of your help!
Doctor Klein: No problem! Try your best to rest for a couple of days. I hope you feel better soon!






Going to a restaurant
Sandra and Paul are at a steak restaurant. A waiter greets them.
"Do you know what you would like to drink?" the waiter asks.
“Water and orange juice,” Sandra says.
"Thank you. Here are your menus," the waiter says.
The waiter brings water for Paul and orange juice for Sandra.
"What would you like to order?" the waiter asks.
"I would like a 12-ounce steak and mashed potatoes," Paul says.
"The same thing, but with green beans," Sandra says.
"And two orders of garlic bread," Paul says.
"Great. You should have it in soon," the waiter says.
The waiter returns after an hour.
“Sorry for your wait. Here are two orders of 12-ounce steaks with mashed potatoes and garlic bread,” the waiter says.
"I asked for green beans with mine," Sandra says.
"I'm sorry, I’ll get those for you," the waiter says.
The waiter quickly returns with Sandra's green beans.



Letter to a friend
Hi, Fred!
It's been a while since we have been in touch. How has your semester been?
I wanted to send you an email update to you let you know how things have been going during my semester abroad here in Málaga, Spain. I've already been here for six weeks, and I feel like I am finally adapting to the culture. I'm also speaking the language more fluently.
I arrived during the first week of September. The weather has been very nice. Even though it's October, it's still rather sunny and warm. In fact, I went to the beach and swam in the Mediterranean Sea earlier today.
I am living with a very welcoming host family. I have my own private bedroom, but we eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner together. On Sundays, we eat a big home-cooked paella for lunch. In Spain, lunch is usually the biggest meal of the day. It's also very common for the people to take a midday nap right after a big meal. I am actually just waking up from my nap right now!
On weekdays, I take classes at the local university. There, I met several native Spanish speakers. They have been very kind and patient with me. At first, I struggled to comprehend their Spanish, but now I understand most of our conversations. They have commented that my Spanish has improved a lot since we first met. Now, I am more confident to use the language in other places like stores and restaurants.
I am so glad that I decided to spend the semester here in Spain. We have an extended weekend coming up, so a group of my friends and I are going to travel to France for four days. It's so easy and inexpensive to travel internationally in Europe. I love it!
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Like I said, don't hesitate to stay in touch more often. Perhaps you could even come to visit! What do you think?
Best wishes,
Patrick



My family at home
My family lives in a small house. It’s simple but pretty. It has a large garden. I like to work in the garden but my sister hates to work in the garden. She prefers to read. She reads in the morning, in the afternoon and at night.
I give all of the vegetables to mom and dad. They like to cook in our small kitchen. I eat any vegetable but my sister eats only a few.
My family always eats breakfast and dinner together. We talk. We laugh. Then my sister washes the dishes.
At night dad likes to listen to music. Mom works on the computer. I watch television. And my sister reads.
Soon we go to bed. My parents go to bed late but my sister and I go to bed early. I’m ready to go to sleep but my sister wants to keep reading.



My morning routine
My name is Bob. Each day I drive my kids to school. My daughter goes to a school that’s far from our house. It takes 30 minutes to get there. Then I drive my son to his school. It’s close to my job. 
My daughter is in the sixth grade and my son is in the second. They are both good students. My daughter usually sings her favorite songs while I drive. My son usually sleeps.
I arrive at the office at 8:30 AM. I say good morning to all my workmates then I get a big cup of hot coffee. I turn on my computer and read my email. Some days I have a lot to read. Soon I need another cup of coffee.



Going to the Supermarket
Martha is at the grocery store, getting ready for a house party. She has a list of what she needs with her as she goes along. The first section she comes has produce. Martha sees apples, bananas, cherries, grapes, and strawberries. She checks her list:
- 6 apples
- 1 bag of cherries
- 1 bag of grapes
- 2 cartons of strawberries
Martha get her items and looks the bananas. They are on sale for much cheaper than they are normally. She picks 3 bananas. Next are vegetables. She sees potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and salad in bags. She checks her list:
- 5 pounds of potatoes
- 6 carrots
- 4 tomatoes
- 2 onions
- 4 mushrooms
As she is putting her items into her cart, Martha checks the many bags of salad and chooses 2 of them. She pushes her cart ahead. The next section is meat and dairy. She sees meat, fish, cheese, eggs, and milk. She checks her list:
- 2 fish (salmon)
- 1 block of cheese (cheddar)
- 1 dozen eggs
- 2 gallons of milk
She looks at the meat that is on sale and chooses a 5-pound roll of hamburger. She gets the rest of the items in that section. She still needs rice, bread, salt, sugar, and flour. She gets:
- 2 bags of rice
- 4 loaves of bread
- a 2-pound bag of sugar
- a 2-pound bag of flour
Martha then realizes that she has forgotten something. She runs back and gets 1 container of salt and then rushes to the checkout. She puts her groceries into her car and leaves.



Martha's  Situation
Martha sees bananas are on sale. Bananas are usually 3 dollars per bunch, but they are 1 dollar today. Martha wants 3 bunches of bananas because she is going to make banana bread. This would normally cost Martha 9 dollars, but today it costs Martha 3 dollars. Martha saved 6 dollars.
Martha also needs 2 bags of flour and 2 bags of sugar. Flour costs 3 dollars per 5-pound bag. Sugar costs 4 dollars per 5-pound bag. It costs 6 dollars for the flour and 8 dollars for the sugar. Together, they cost 14 dollars.
In total, Martha spends 3 dollars on 3 bunches of bananas, 6 dollars on 2 bags of flour, and 8 dollars on 2 bags of sugar. Martha pays 17 dollars for 7 items.



Paul and Sandra´s Situation
Paul and Sandra go to a steak restaurant. The steaks are 2 dollars per ounce. A 12-ounce steak is 24 dollars. Paul and Sandra both want a 12-ounce steak. They pay 48 dollars for both steaks. 
Sandra puts 60 dollars on the table, leaving the 12 dollars in change as a tip for their waiter.
On the way home, they need to get gasoline for Paul’s car. Gas costs 3 dollars a gallon. He needs to get 15 gallons of gasoline. Paul must 45 dollars at the gas station. 
Paul pays 50 dollars and he gets 5 dollars of change back in change from the cashier



Numbers
Most individuals don't think about numbers, or numerical representations of quantity, but they play a major part in everyday life. To be sure, numbers determine the time individuals will wake up in the morning, how much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is, and much, much more.
Additionally, numbers impact everyday living on a much smaller scale. In the grocery store, for instance, numbers determine products' prices, the amount of a product available for purchase, how much money will need to be paid for products, and a whole lot else.
To understand larger (and more intimidating numbers), interested persons first need to understand basic numbers, or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a multi-digit number that indicates a larger amount/quantity.
The basic numbers are as follows:
One (1)
Example: "He purchased one watermelon from the grocery store."
Two (2)
Example: "She bought two types of bread from the store."
Three (3)
Example: "He decided to get three bags of onions when he went shopping."
Four (4)
Example: "In preparation for the party, Janice bought four cartons of ice cream at the store."
Five (5)
Example: "Joe picked up five boxes of cereal from the breakfast aisle."
Six (6)
Example: "A pound of beef costs a lot of money at my favorite grocery store."
Seven (7)
Example: "Seven of the 10 aisles at my local grocery store contain pasta."
Eight (8)
Example: "I bought eight cookies for the price of four at the store."
Nine (9)
Example: "There were only nine loafs of bread left at the grocery store."
Ten (10)
Example: "Ten pineapples sure is a lot, don't you think?"
After ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19), and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most prices are 10 dollars or less; it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of grocery shopping, for when the bill must be paid.
After twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow. So long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult. For example thirty-three (33) is simply "thirty" plus three; sixty-seven is "sixty" plus seven; and sixty-nine is simply "sixty" plus nine.



The city where I live
My name is Clark, and I will tell you about my city.
I live in an apartment. In my city, there is a post office where people mail letters. On Monday, I go to work. I work at the post office. Everyone shops for food at the grocery store. They also eat at the restaurant. The restaurant serves pizza and ice cream.
My friends and I go to the park. We like to play soccer at the park. On Fridays, we go to the cinema to see a movie. Children don't go to school on the weekend. Each day, people go to the hospital when they are sick. The doctors and nurses take care of them. The police keep everyone safe. I am happy to live in my city



The Pet Store
George is at the pet store, looking at what kind of pet he might want to get for his birthday. George asked if he could have a horse, but his parents said no because horses are too big.
First, he sees dogs and cats. Baby dogs are called puppies. Baby cats are called kittens. George likes them because they are easy to take care of and can play a lot, but they will get bigger. George wants a small pet.
Then George sees animals that have to live in a cage. He sees rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. Mice are what you call more than one mouse. He likes these animals because they are small. Birds live in cages too. George sees a parrot and a canary. He likes them all, but he doesn’t want to clean the cage.
George sees the animals in tanks. The tanks full of water have fish and turtles in them. He thinks about a goldfish but decides he likes the turtles more. There are also tanks with rocks and sand that have snakes, spiders, and scorpions, but George is afraid of them. George likes the turtles best, but they won’t fit in the little fishbowls. Turtles need bigger tanks, so they can swim sometimes and hide sometimes.
George decides he wants to get a turtle for his birthday. He buys a book on how to take care of a turtle and a list of what types of turtles the store has.



Archaeologists identify the mummy of a lost Egyptian queen 
Egyptian archaeologists announced on Wednesday that they have identified a mummy discovered in 1903 as that of Queen Hatshepsut (hat-shep-soot), Egypt’s most powerful female pharaoh. The mummy was originally found in the Valley of the Kings, a sacred burial site for kings and powerful nobles located on the west bank of the Nile River in Egypt. Although the mummy was discovered more than a century ago, it remained in a tomb until this past spring, when it was brought to the Cairo Museum for testing.
A Powerful Ruler’s Legacy
Queen Hatshepsut was the only woman to rule ancient Egypt while the kingdom was at the height of its wealth and power, from about 1502 to 1482 B.C. Of all the female pharaohs–including Cleopatra and Nefertiti–Hatshepsut’s reign was the longest and most successful. While in power, she established trade routes and built hundreds of monuments and temples throughout Egypt. Despite her prosperous reign, both her mummy and her legacy were virtually erased from Egyptian history. Many historians believe that Tuthmose III, Hatshepsut’s stepson, destroyed records and monuments bearing her name. It may have been his revenge. It is believed that she stole the throne from him. Finding the mummy of this powerful queen may provide details about an important part of Egyptian history.



Accommodation
Hi Ellie,
I’m so pleased you can come surfing in August! Paul, Rose and Kevin are coming too, so there will be five of us. We’ve decided to return to New Sands for a couple of days, because the surf board hire is so cheap there.
I’m starting to think about accommodation. We won’t camp again after last year! I hated staying in a tent in all that rain!
Kevin wants to hire a caravan. There are some nice ones with 3 bedrooms, showers and cooking facilities. The problem is, none of the caravan parks take short bookings in the summer. The minimum stay is a week. It’s a shame because there are several nice parks near the beach.
There’s a hostel for young people in New Sands. It’s the cheapest option after camping, and there’s a big kitchen and dining room where we can cook. The problem is, accommodation is in dormitories and I don’t really want to sleep with strangers.
There are a few guest houses in New Sands. Some have triple rooms, so we only need to book two rooms. We’ll have to book soon if we choose that option, because many guest houses are already full. The hotels in New Sands are too expensive, although I’d love to stay at the Sunrise Pavilion with its large pool!
The final option is to rent a cottage. I found one. It has three bedrooms – a double, a single and a twin, so two of us would have to share a bed! There’s a big kitchen diner with a microwave, washing machine and dishwasher. The living room has a TV and DVD player. There’s just one bathroom, but there’s a separate WC. There’s a nice garden too. The problem is, it’s 5 miles from the beach.
Let me know which option you prefer.



It's in the News
Texting while walking is dangerous
Writing text messages and walking is dangerous. It is more dangerous than driving and texting. More people get injured while walking than driving. Walking in a straight line is not easy. We can forget how to walk properly. Dangerous things can happen. We run into people or cars. We fall over things in the street.
There are a few reasons why texting and walking is dangerous. People cannot see when they look at their keyboard. Their minds are somewhere else – they are not thinking about walking safely. Thousands of people have accidents. Some have serious head injuries.
Too much jogging could be a problem!
Running is good for our health. A recent study says that running too much is bad for us and it doesn’t always make our lives longer. A specialist said too much running can damage your heart. Long-distance runners and people who never exercise can have the same risk of having a heart
attack.
Experts looked at the health of 3,300 runners. Most of them ran over 30 kilometres a week. Marathon runners had hard parts in their heart. A doctor who started running in 1967 is sad. He ran 60 kilometres every week. He thought his heart was strong. Now he has heart problems. He said we should exercise, but not too much.



Black Friday
The day after Thanksgiving has become America’s biggest shopping day. Closed all day on Thursday, shopping centres all across the nation open early on Friday. Some of them open at 12:01 Friday morning, while others open at 4 a.m. Some “sleepyhead“ shopping centres, like Target this year, don’t open their doors on Friday until 6 a.m. From Friday to the day before Christmas, this is the season when businesses make nearly 25 per cent of what they earn in a year. This season puts many businesses “in the black”, that is, they make the money they need for the year.
Reporters from local TV stations interview people who sleep in tents in front of the shops a day or two before the doors open on Friday. These people patiently wait in queue to get products that are 50 per cent cheaper or more.
“Oh, we have fun,” said one of the persons queuing. “We sometimes bring games to play, we watch TV and order lots of pizza, and we often meet interesting people. And, most important of all, we save a lot!” The problem, of course, is that only a very small number of products have big reductions in their prices. Apart from a few big discounts, each shop has other things that are reduced from 10 to 50 per cent, saving shoppers from $10 to $400 per item, and so Americans want to go shopping.
Not all Americans enjoy shopping. Reverend William Graham wants to change Black Friday’s name. “We want to call it Remember Jesus Friday. People should start the season with the right attitude. Christmas has become a Season of Shopping. We want to make it a Season of Giving. And we don’t mean giving material things. We mean giving your back, your mind, and your hands. Help an old lady clean up her house. Teach a kid how to read. Visit sick people in the hospital or in nursing homes. Give food to the Red Cross. Celebrate Christmas by remembering Jesus and forgetting Santa Claus.”

Chinese New Year
Chinese New Year (or generally referred to as Lunar New Year globally) is the Chinese festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese calendar. The festival is usually referred to as the Spring Festival in mainland China, and is one of several Lunar New Years in Asia.
Celebrations traditionally take place from the evening preceding the first day of the year to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February. In 2019, the first day of the Chinese New Year was on Tuesday, 5 February, initiating the Year of the Pig.
Chinese New Year is a major holiday in Greater China and has strongly influenced lunar new year celebrations of China’s neighbouring cultures, including the Korean New Year (seol), the Tết of Vietnam, and the Losar of Tibet. It is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries with significant Overseas Chinese populations, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Mauritius, as well as many in North America and Europe.
Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honour divinities as well as ancestors. Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the New Year vary widely, and the evening preceding Chinese New Year’s Day is frequently regarded as an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red paper-cuts and two-line poems. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and two-line poems include that of good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes.  
For the northern regions of China, dumplings are featured prominently in meals celebrating the festival. It often serves as the first meal of the year.

Being and Adult
I used to think that I'd know I was an adult when I got married, bought a home and had children.
However, high house prices, and the desire to marry only when both partners have permanent, secure jobs means that for many people these events now come later in their lives
than they might once have done. Just because at this point, I have none of above, it doesn´t mean that I haven't grow up,
In fact, the 2014 Clark Established Adult Poll found that people on my generation now see financial independence and making our own decisions as the evidence that we are grown-up.
Modern life gives those in their 20's more time to "find themselves" before they settle down.  This is a period that is unknown in traditional societies, where people get married earlier.
It has led to some researchers labelling them the "me generation". They believe that this focus on the individual is bad for democracy and for society.
However, Erica Bourne, a social scientist, says about contemporary young people " It´s true that they are not as interested in politics, but all data shows that they are interested 
in social change and finding creative ways to make a difference". 




Retail therapy
Retail therapy, or shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood is a myth, right? Well, no actually.
A recent study has found that shopping can actually be an affective way of decreasing feelings of sadness.
Researchers in the UK asked shoppers on their way into a shopping center to describe how they were feeling .
They (1) then measured their mood level again after they had been shopping. 
Those (2) who had been in a bad mood before they went in were found to have significantly raised their mood level by buying something to cheer themselves up.
The research was funded by business owners, who wanted to know if their store design was appropiate.
They (3) are pleased with the results, and are thinking about inviting the researchers to repeat the research in other locations. 



7 tips for a tidy desk
1. Only keep things you really need on and near your desk.
Use a tray for any papers you have to read. Have a jar for pens and pencils and have a bin near your desk.
2. Don’t keep any drinks on your desk.
Go to the kitchen when you want to have a drink or, if you prefer, keep a drink on a small table near your desk.
3. Reduce the amount of paper that you use.
Try to keep as much information as possible in folders on your computer. Before printing a document, ask yourself, ‘do I really need to read this on paper?’
4. Scan your notes.
If you have a lot of paper (magazine articles, notes, worksheets, etc.), use a scanner and keep a digital version as a PDF on your computer.
5. Use your smartphone to take photos of things you need to remember.
For example, take photos of notes to yourself, the name and address of a place you need to visit or diagrams you need to study for school.
6. Get a noticeboard.
If you really do need to keep small bits of paper, use a noticeboard on the wall. Check it every day and throw old notes in the bin.
7. Clean your desk at the end of every day.
Choose a time to tidy your desk and do it! If you do it every day, it will only take five minutes and you can start each new day with a clean and tidy space.



My Town
I live in Newquay. It’s a small town on the Atlantic coast in the south of England. It has got great beaches and is the best place to surf in the UK. There are lots of surf schools where you can learn how to surf. I go surfing with my friends every weekend. My favourite place is Fistral Beach.
I love Newquay because there are lots of other things to do as well as surfing. If you like water sports, you can go kayaking, water-skiing or coasteering. Coasteering is different because it is rock climbing, jumping into the sea and swimming in the same activity, but you should always go with a special instructor.
If you like animals you can also visit the Blue Reef Aquarium and see lots of different fish and even sharks. You can also go horse riding on the beach or visit Newquay Zoo. There are lots of other attractions too like mini golf and bowling. Come and see for yourself!



Travel to England
Last summer, Joel and Sara traveled to England for two weeks. They traveled in August and stayed in a college with other students in Brighton, the South of England.
It was fantastic, because they talked to a lot of students from different nationalities and learned a lot about other cultures and customs. Of course, they learned a lot of English too because they practiced it every day.
In the morning they studied a little, they asked the teacher to speak slowly when necessary and answered her questions. In the afternoon, they visited different places and played different sports at the college.
It was so much fun. They often walked down to the beach with their new friends and played or chatted. In the evening, they were tired so they sometimes watched videos or played board games.
The best days were Saturday and Sunday because they traveled to London. The city is very big and they visited all the monuments like Big Ben, The London Eye, and Buckingham Palace. They wanted to see the Queen but they didn’t see her, only her guards!
They liked everything in the city but their favorite thing was the museums, especially Madam Tussards. There were lots of realistic figures of famous people there.
At the end of the two weeks, they were sad to return home. The holidays were fun and different from the usual. They cried a little when they waved goodbye to their new friends and promised to write or send emails when they arrived home.



What things are important in my life?
Well, I’ve got an old car. It isn’t very fast,
but I love it. What else? Well, my mobile’s
very important to me. It’s got all my friends’
phone numbers on it, my photos, music,
everything! I haven’t got a laptop, but I’ve got
an old computer. That’s important to me for
school. And I’ve got a big TV in my room.
That’s very important because I love football!




To: Ellie Crest
Subject: Surfing Holiday
Hi Ellie,
I’m so pleased you can come surfing in August! Paul, Rose and Kevin are coming too, so there will be five of us.  We’ve decided to return to New Sands, because the surf board hire is so cheap there. 
I’m starting to think about accommodation. We won’t camp again after last year! I hated staying in a tent in all that rain!
Kevin wants to hire a caravan. There are some nice ones with 3 bedrooms, showers and cooking facilities. The problem is, none of the caravan parks take short bookings in the summer. The minimum stay is a week. It’s a shame because there are several nice parks near the beach.
There’s a youth hostel in New Sands. It’s the cheapest option after camping, and there’s a big kitchen and dining room where we can cook. The problem is, accommodation is in dormitories and I don’t really want to sleep with strangers. 
There are a few guest houses in New Sands. Some have triple rooms, so we’d only need to book two rooms. They’re not expensive, but we wouldn’t be able to cook there. We’d have to eat out at restaurants, or eat sandwiches for every meal!  We’ll have to book soon if we choose that option, because many guest houses are already full. The hotels in New Sands are far too expensive, even though I’d love to stay at the Sunrise Pavilion with its rooftop pool!
The final option is to rent a cottage. Few cottages offer mid-week breaks in summer, but I found one. It has three bedrooms - a double, a single and a twin, so two of us would have to share a bed!  There’s a big kitchen diner with a microwave, washing machine and dishwasher. The living room has a TV and DVD player. There’s just one bathroom, but there’s a separate WC.  There’s a nice garden too. The problem is, it’s 5 miles from the beach, so we’d have to hire a car, because there aren’t any buses.
Let me know which option you prefer.
Cheers
Natalie



Read about a woman’s job as a Christmas elf!
A few years ago, I worked as an elf at a holiday resort in Lapland, in the north of Sweden.  The resort was in a forest. Visitors and workers stayed in small wooden cabins all around the forest.  There was one large cabin where people ate meals. I started work there in mid November and stayed until just after Christmas.
Tourists used to stay at the resort for four days. On the first day, they arrived at the airport and travelled to the resort by coach.  I didn’t have to work until the evening. Sometimes I went skiing. Then, while the guests had their evening meal, I worked behind the desk in reception. I helped people find their cabins, told them about the itinerary and sold tickets for extra tours. I didn’t dress as an elf at that time; I wore the hotel uniform.
On day 2, I and three other elves got up at about eight o’clock. Of course, it was still dark at that time. In Lapland it gets light at about half past ten during the winter, and it gets dark again soon after two o’clock.  We dressed in our elf costumes and drove across the snow on skidoos to a cabin in the forest.  Inside the cabin, there were huge presents and huge tools.  We had to wrap the presents and pretend to make toys with the tools.  There were mirrors in the cabin windows. These made us look very small. When tourists looked through the windows, they saw tiny elves using normal-sized tools!
On the third day, we went to a different cabin – Santa’s cabin!  This was the day when the children finally met Father Christmas.  The children would meet Santa and get a toy. Then they came into the elves’ workshop to meet us. This room was full of toys and beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree.  I and the other elves pretended to make toys and chatted to the children in our own elf language.
The next day, the tourists went home and the next group arrived. I worked on reception again.
Working as an elf was great fun, and a magical way to spend Christmas!

The New Shopping Mall
Gatesbridge’s new Merriwether Mall is opening this September.  With an area of 320,000 square metres, the Merriweather Mall will be the biggest mall in the south west.  It’s located close to the motorway, has its own bus station and 2000 car parking spaces, so it is convenient for everyone. 
The mall has five areas, all under cover. The largest, Main Street, is a shopping area on three floors. Here, you’ll find all the major chain stores and department stores.  You can buy fashion items and all the famous brand names. There is also a large chemist.
Situated on two levels, the market square is where you can find traditional market stalls. On the lower floor, there are food stalls, including a butcher’s, baker’s, a fishmonger’s, greengrocer’s and delicatessen. On the upper floor, you will find stalls selling hardware and haberdashery.
Bohemia is at the rear of the mall. Here, you’ll find quirky, independent shops selling everything from second hand music and books to clothes and handicrafts. 
The Palisade is more upmarket. Here you will find fashion boutiques, jewellers, antiques and furniture.  There are also two banks and a post office located along The Palisade.
The Showground is the entertainment centre of the mall.  On the ground floor, there is a food court where you’ll find cuisine from around the world, including Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Italian food.  There is a large arena where events will take place through the year. There is also an eight-screen cinema, a night club and a bowling alley.
And if that is not enough, we are offering you a voucher which will give you £10 off any purchase over £40 that you make in the Merriwether Mall between 10th and 16th September. You can’t afford to miss it!





Education
You’re 16 and finally you can leave school!  By now, you’re probably sick of teachers, desks, tests and exams.  But don’t just run for the exit. You need to think carefully about what to do next.
If you want a professional career, you will need to go to university and get a degree. To do that, you need to stay at high school for another two years.  But you needn’t stay at the same place. There are several options in the district of Northacre.
St. Leopold’s School has the best pass rate of all the high schools in the district. It offers a wide range of subjects in the humanities and sciences.  St Leopold’s is, of course, a private school, so may be too expensive for you. But don’t worry, there are several other options if you want to follow the academic route.  Knowle Grammar School is a state school, so there are no fees, and it has excellent tuition and facilities. It is a boys’ school from the ages of 11-16, but from 16-18 it is co-educational. But it is selective, so you’ll have to pass an exam to get in.  If you’re interested in going into Business, check out Wyle River Academy.  This school specialises in subjects like Business Studies, Management and Economics.  If you prefer the arts, look at the courses on offer at Northacre College.  Here you can study woodwork, art, textiles and much more.
Northacre College also offers a wide range of vocational qualifications.  You can do a 1-year certificate or a 2-year diploma in subjects like electrics, plumbing, roofing and hairdressing.  If you’d prefer to work outdoors, look at Milldown College, where there are courses in Farm Mechanics, Land Management, Animal Management and much more.
A final option is to get an apprenticeship with a local or national company.  You will get on-the-job training, gain certificates or diplomas and start earning straight away.  But be warned - places are limited!  Find out more at the Jobs Fair on 26th May at Northacre College.

Madagascar- When to go
Madagascar has two seasons, a warm, wet season from November to April, and a cooler dry season between May and October. However, different parts of the country have very different weather.
The east coast is hotter and wetter, with up to 4000mm of rainfall per year. In the rainy season, there are strong winds, and these can cause a lot of damage.  Avoid visiting eastern Madagascar between January and March because the weather can make road travel very difficult.  The dry season is cooler and more pleasant.
The high, central part of the country is much drier and cooler. About 1,400 mm of rain falls in the rainy season, with some thunderstorms, but the summer is usually sunny and dry, but it can be cold, especially in the mornings, with freezing showers, and it may snow in mountain areas above 2,400m, and even stay there for several days.
The west coast is the driest part of the island. Here, the winter months are pleasant with little rain, cooler temperatures and blue skies.  The summers can be extremely hot, especially in the southwest.  This part of the country is semi-desert, and only gets around 300mm of rain per year.



Tamara
Something very strange happened to Tamara. She never knew she had a twin sister until she started university!
Tamara was born in Mexico. Her parents could not look after her so she went to live with a family in Manhattan, USA.
When Tamara was twenty years old, she started university in Long Island. She enjoyed her university life. But one day she was walking home from class, and a student smiled at her. “Hello Adriana!” said the student. “I’m not Adriana,” said Tamara.
This happened to Tamara again and again. People Tamara didn’t know kept calling her Adriana. It was very strange. One day, when a woman called her Adriana, Tamara asked “Why do you keep calling me Adriana?”
The woman replied, “You look like my friend Adriana. You have the same face and the same hair. Is Adriana your sister?” Tamara said that she did not have a sister called Adriana. But she was interested in this girl Adriana. Finally she asked someone for Adriana’s email address.
When Tamara wrote to Adriana, she found out that they both had the same birthday, they looked the same and both of them were from Mexico.When Tamara went to live with the family in Manhattan, Adriana moved to Long Island to live with a family there. It had to be true! Adriana and Tamara were twin sisters!



Living in the UK
Madeleine came from Dakar to London five years ago. In the beginning she missed everything – the weather, the food, her family. But now she owns a profitable business with her two sisters and her brother. They run a pound shop in London's West End. Madeleine's boyfriend is now her husband, and they have three children who go to British schools. When asked why she came to England, Madeleine says immediately, 'Because I'd like to work hard and be successful.' She definitely works hard. She's at the shop all day, then she works as a senior care assistant in the evening. 'That's why I love England,' she says.' You can be whatever you want to be. ''When I first came to England, I didn't speak the language, and it was autumn. It was so cold and rainy! Now almost all my family are here, not only in London, but also in Scotland, and in Wales. We meet about twice a year and have a huge Senegalese meal that takes about three hours! We're all happy here."
 



An Irish teenager´s typical day
My name is Sean O'Brien. I'm fifteen years old and I live in Cork in Ireland. From Monday to Saturday my daily routine is always the same. My mum always starts at seven o'clock in the morning when I get up and wash my face. After that, I do some exercises, put my clothes on, and prepare my school bag. Then I go downstairs and have a breakfast with my mum and dad. I usually have sandwich and a cup of tea, but I never have sausages and eggs. After breakfast I always make my bed and then I go to school. I stay at school from eight o'clock in the morning till half past two in the afternoon. On Mondays and Wednesdays I stay later because I have drum lessons. On the other days I usually play football with my friends. When I get home I sometimes help my mother in the house. I usually do my homework from five o'clock to seven o'clock in the evening. At around seven o'clock we all have dinner together. After dinner I usually watch some TV and chat with my family. At 10 o'clock I read a book and go to bed. After such a busy day, I always feel sleepy and ready for my comfortable bed!



Dutch Forger May go to prision
German police have just arrested Dutch artist Andreas Van den Berg in Hamburg for forgery. Yesterday he sold a Rembrandt copy to a Berlin art dealer for 4,3 million euros. Van den Berg is Dutch but was born in Hamburg and has lived there all his life. His father was the famous painter Lucas Van den Berg, and his son has learnt a lot from him. He has been an outstanding painter for many years and could copy different styles of paintings since he was twelve years old; he could do everything from Rembrandt to Andy Warhol. Three years ago Hermann Schneider saw Van der Berg in a Hamburg bar. 'It was very strange, he didn't know any of the customers in the bar but he bought lunch for everybody.' I really couldn't understand it – he was only seventeen and he had a lot of money. I've been very interested in Andreas Van den Berg since that day.' A week ago Van den Berg went to an art gallery with a Rembrandt painting. Schneider followed him and waited for a quarter of an hour. Then Van den Berg left with a big suitcase and ran quickly into a bus station. The owner of the gallery told Schneider that the painting was just a cheap imitation. Schneider arrested Van den Berg at his office a few hours later. Van den Berg was only arrested yesterday, but his wife has already spoken to Die Welt.



Child Labour
You don't need to be an adult to help others. In November 1999, when she was just thirteen years old, Rosie Williams was looking for the sports section in the newspaper. A story about a girl by the name of Armineh Ghafoor caught her eye. Armineh Ghafoor, who lived in Afghanistan, had been forced to work long days in a carpet factory. She had worked fourteen hours a day, seven days a week from the time she was six years old until she escaped. Her job was to tie small knots in the carpets. The article shocked Rosie. Armineh Ghafoor was the same age as Rosie. Rosie just couldn't imagine what it was like to work all day seven days a week and never have a chance to attend school or play. Rosie tore the article out of the newspaper and put it in her rucksack. But she couldn't get Armineh Ghafoor out of her mind. Riding the bus to school, she took the article out of her rucksack and read it again and again. After school, she went to the local library and got as much information as she could find on child labour and exploitation. The next morning, with the teacher's permission, she told the class about Armineh Ghafoor and about the thousands of children who were forced to work in plantations, mines and factories.
 



Valentine´s Day tradition in America
Those who enjoy Valentine's Day may have wonderful memories of this day from elementary school. In elementary school, if you behave well you might get to make a Valentine's Day mailbox. Then you can decorate it by colouring it read or pink. Next, you can glue on hearts, cupids, rainbows or flowers. When the day arrives, the teacher lets you run around filling every mailbox with cards. Most children give one card to every student and one for the teacher. Sometimes their parents make them write cards to the nerdy or annoying kids. The most popular cards are pre-packaged. The characters from Disney movies are most popular, so are sports designs and characters from cartoons or TV shows, like Power Rangers or the Simpsons. As a teenager, finding a date for the Valentine's Day dance is very important. At this crucial stage in growing up, being seen with a cool person is essential. If everyone turns you down for the dance, feelings of hatred for the holiday may ignite early in life. In high school, nobody makes mailboxes any longer, but some people still send cards. You might find a card in your locker, unsigned or with the words "From your secret admirer." This sparks mystery and intrigue. The next decision is – What to do? Should you find out who sent it or keep it a secret???




Hi Luke,
It's the semi-final on Saturday. Chelsea are playing against Arsenal and I really want to go and see the match. My brother said he can take me and a friend to watch it. Would you like to come with us? It'll be great! We can get chips and a Pepsi and watch the match and have fun. Can you call me on Thursday afternoon, because we have to buy the tickets? If you want to come, we'll come over to your house to pick you up.
Bye for now,
Jimmy

Hi Gina,
I've got three tickets - there were none for Friday so we have to go on Saturday. I'll meet you at the entrance at 6.45, OK? Bring me your ticket money tomorrow. Lucky that we're still at school - it costs less. Oh, and I'll get some drinks, but we'll need something to eat - can you bring snacks? Don't forget!

Charlie's Place
Charlie’s is a new American restaurant, near the subway on Fifth Avenue. It is open 365 days a year,
including Christmas. The prices are very reasonable – that’s probably why it’s popular with young people
and parents with kids. Charlie’s does good hamburgers and chips, but why are there hardly any salads or
vegetables? There is karaoke every evening from 10.00 pm to 3.00 am. It’s a relaxed and informal
restaurant and there are always lots of customers. Service is very nice, fast and helpful. Go there with all
your friends and have fun but not if you want to stay slim! 




Learning to swim
a) Rachel Robbins: I learnt to swim when I was a teenager. I went to the local swimming pool with
my two sisters. It was old and cold and not very nice. I can still remember my instructor: his name
was Colin Firth, like the actor. But he wasn’t as good-looking!
b) Geoffrey Hopkins: It took me a long time to learn. I wasn’t a natural. I still don’t swim very well. I
certainly wouldn’t like to be in a boat in rough seas. I never really learnt to put my face in the water.
It hurts my eyes and I can’t see.
c) Simon Fordham: My father was a swimming instructor so I guess it’s in the blood. I can’t
remember a time when I couldn’t swim. I spent most of my childhood holidays at the beach and I
still go at any opportunity I get.
d) Karen Marks: One day I was standing by the deep end of the swimming pool and I suddenly fell in. I don’t know how I did it but I managed to get to the side. I was coughing but I could swim! My
brother saw me when I got out and thought it was very funny. But he didn’t laugh when I hit him.
e) Phillip Parker: I was on a small boat with about ten other boys. It was very small and someone
pushed me in the water. The water was very clean and I could see everything. I remember feeling
very peaceful and comfortable, I wasn’t worried at all. I started swimming, not very well, but
another boy helped me to return to the beach. 




Hi! How are you?
Thanks for the e-mail. Sorry for not answering sooner. I’ve just come back from
Angra Dos Reis, Brazil, with Maria. I’m very tired because we couldn’t get a direct flight back. We left from
JFK airport at six o’clock this morning! We had the most wonderful time in Brazil. We stayed at the Green
Park Hotel, which is about six kilometres from the town. It was very comfortable and good value for
money. I can definitely recommend it. The weather was great – very hot and the people were superb. The
only problem was the food. There wasn’t much variety and I got bored eating the same things every day.
The first week we spent in the gym and on the beach. Then Maria’s parents came for the second week.
All the best.

Prince Charles gives money to school
The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, visited
a junior school in Buckinghamshire last week
to help children with a project about the Royal
Family. He told the children about his life as a
member of Britain’s most famous family and
the duties which go with his title. He then let
photos be taken of him with the children and
the teachers for the project work. One of the
questions the children asked was “How much
pocket money do your sons get?”





Footballer wants to help children
Footballer Roman Gregory has started a UNICEF
campaign to help children hurt in accidents with
land mines, in countries at war and in peace. The
footballer says he cannot imagine being without
an arm or a leg and knows that many people do
not even think about what the children who have
had such injuries go through. “Many accidents
with land mines happen when children are just
playing happily in the fields”, says Roman, who
hopes to get £1 million in the campaign.



Bill Clinton caught in snow in Austria

Owned and managed by the Greenwood family, Rudstone Walk has become renowned over the years for
its hospitality and highest quality standards.
For business it provides a peaceful retreat at the end of a working day - less than five minutes from the

For pleasure it is ideally located for a relaxing break within easy reach of York and the many other

There is an excellent rail service from nearby Brough to all U.K. mainline stations.
The M62 is just 2 miles from Rudstone Walk, offering a direct route to Hull (20 minutes), Leeds (45 minutes),

Young blog writers
Tasha
Last year I wrote for my college magazine, which I found really difficult, but I
don’t think it’s hard to write a good blog. Mine is about things from daily life
that make me laugh. My older brother also has a blog, but we’re writing about
different subjects. We don’t discuss what we’re planning, but we read each
other’s blogs sometimes. I like giving advice to people who write in asking for
it – it’s good to know I’ve helped.
Danni
I started writing my popular film blog because I love movies. I like it when
readers send me articles by email about a film they’ve seen, and I put these on
my blog for everyone to read. I’m still at college, so I’m careful about spending
too long on my blog, which is difficult as writing well takes time. I don’t think I’ll
write it for much longer. I’m busy, and it’s time to do something new.
Chrissie
I began writing on a school magazine. I stopped after a few years, but I missed
it, so I started my own – I’m still writing it now! The blog’s new for me, and I write
about daily life. I get ideas from friends or my sister when I can’t decide what to
write about – we always think of something interesting, sad or serious. At first,
almost nobody visited my site, but now more do, I’ve had some lovely
comments



A family of dancers
The women in the Watson family are all crazy about ballet. These
days, Alice Watson gives ballet lessons, but for many years, she was
a dancer with the National Ballet Company. Her mother, Hannah, also
had a full-time job there, making costumes for the dancers.
Alice’s daughter Demi started learning ballet as soon as she could
walk. ‘I never taught her,’ says Alice, ‘because she never let me.’ Now
aged sixteen, Demi is a member of the ballet company where her
mother was the star dancer for many years.
Alice’s husband, Jack, is an electrician. They met while he was working at a theatre where she was
dancing and got married soon after. ‘When Demi started dancing, the house was too small for her
and Alice to practise in so I made the garage into a dance studio. Now the living room is nice and
quiet when I’m watching television!’ he says.
Last month, Demi was invited to dance in the ballet Swan Lake. Of course, Alice and Hannah were
in the audience and even Jack was there, which made it very special for Demi. Jack says, ‘I’m not
that interested in ballet myself but it’s fantastic seeing Demi taking her first steps with Alice’s old
company!’ Demi was wearing a dress that Hannah made for Alice many years before.
‘It was very exciting for all of us,’ says Hannah. ‘Demi’s way of dancing is very like Alice’s. I know I’m
her grandmother, but I think she has a great future!’ 




Hi Toni!
Saturday will be a nice weather, so I want to go swimming.
Do you want to go with me? I want to visit a pool in park.
We can travel on the bus. It is faster and not expensive. What
do you think?
Alex




Hi Alex,
Do you want to go swimming with me on Saturday? I want to
go swimming pool at new sports centre. We will travel by bus
because pupils are cheaper.



Hi Kevin,
I am happy for your mail. I want to swim to golden beach on
saturday. We can go with a car from my father. Are you OK?



Marta,
Do you like to the beach? Maybe we have a nice weather and eat
an ice cream, or play volleyball. 



Banking
Banking and banks are very important for the functioning of the modern world. Without banks the way we use money would not work. Banks enable people to save money, borrow money and to pay for things with ease and security.
Each country in the world has its own well known banks that have branches in nearly every city so that they are convenient for people to use. People often have to visit the local branch of the bank when they want certain services. There are also some very big multinational banks that have branches in most countries in the world.
As well as the local branches that are in most cities, each bank will also have a head office. This is where all central tasks are performed that let the local braches function. The people that work in the branches will be the bank manager, the person in charge, and various tellers who work behind the bank counter and help the customers. There will also likely be security guards to protect the money, workers and customers.
Most customers will just need to see the tellers when they go to the bank if they are paying money into their account as either cash or a check. However, they might need to see the bank manager if they want to open an account or if they have become overdraw, when they have spent more money than there was in the account. Also if they want to borrow money and get a loan the person will need to see the bank manager who will have to approve it.
As well as being able to use cash or checks to pay for things, banks also offer their customers the more convenient methods of using either a debit card or credit card. These methods are very convenient as you just need to carry a small plastic card to be able to pay for anything. When paying with plastic you will need to either sign a receipt or enter a PIN number to conform the purchase and that you are authorized to use the card.



Doctors
When most people are ill with a non-life threatening condition they will most often see a General Practitioner, a GP, also called a Family Doctor. These doctors generally work in the local community in surgeries rather than in hospitals, so they are convenient for people to see for a consultation. However, other GPs can work in a very wide range of areas, such as in hospitals, in education and for insurance companies.
As the name suggests, GPs are doctors that do not have a specialty, such as a brain surgeon or cancer specialist: they are able to diagnose and treat all the possible diseases and problem that one of their patients might have. They can treat and manage most illnesses and perform some minor surgeries in their practice. Then for more serious cases they will refer the patient to a specialist that will work in a hospital.
If you are ill and need to see a GP you will normally need to make an appointment. Sometimes you can just walk into the surgery and see a doctor, but that is not very likely as GPs are normally very busy and all their appointment times will be fully booked. Often you have to wait several hours if not at least one of two days before you can get an appointment with a GP. If you are too ill to wait you have to go to a hospital and visit the accident and emergency department. 
GPs also make house-calls. These are when the GP comes to your house to treat you or see a patient. Most often a GP has to make house-calls to see elderly people who cannot get to the surgery easily. They might be ill and need to doctor to give them medicine or it could be that the GP just want to check on them and make sure that they are ok.
If you are ill, the doctor will normally prescribe you some medicine and tell you to go away for a few days before you go back and visit them again if you have not started to get better. The GP will also explain how you can have a better lifestyle that could prevent you from becoming ill in the first place. They will normally recommend that you stop smoking cigarettes (if you do), not to drink too much alcohol and to get exercise. Once you have your prescription you will need to visit a pharmacy to get the medicine the doctor prescribed you.

Halloween
Halloween is a celebration that happens on the 31st of October. It originally came from a Christian religious day. The 1st of November is All Saints Day, so Halloween is the eve or night before this. Nowadays it is mainly just an excuse for people to have fun.
The holiday was mainly celebrated in America and from there has spread to many other countries. It is meant to be the day, and mainly the night, when monsters come out of hiding. This means that people associate scary and frightening things with Halloween.
There are three main traditions linked to Halloween. The first is carving pumpkins, the second is decorating your house and the third is trick-or-treating.
Pumpkins are big vegetables that go an orange color when they are ripe and ready to eat. When someone carves a pumpkin they cut the top off it and scoop out all the seeds and flesh from the inside. Then they carve a pattern into the outside of the pumpkin. Often they cut the pattern so that there are holes into the center of the pumpkin. It is traditional to carve your pumpkin into a scary face. Then when it is dark you put a candle or light inside the pumpkin so the light shines out of the frightening face that was carved.
Then the pumpkins would be used to decorate your house. You would put them in a window or on the front porch so people in the street can see them. However, the decorations have become much better over the years. Now people try to make their houses look as if they are a haunted house by making skeletons to hang in the garden or putting tombstones outside the house. They might also make it look as if there are lots of spider webs. The people from the house try to make it look as scary as possible. 
Finally, children will get dressed up in costumes and go out trick-or-treating. This is where they go to people’s houses and ask for sweets or candy, their treat. If the house refused to give them anything then they would play a trick on the house. Adults do not go trick-or-treating, unless that are looking after children, but do often have their own parties at night. At these parties people would also be dressed up as monsters or anything else that is scary.



Pets
Many people like to keep pets. Some just have one pet while other people keep many different pets. This often depends on if they live in a big or small house. If a person lives in a small house, or even a flat or apartment, they cannot keep a lot of pets as there is not enough room. If people live in a big house that has a garden then they will be able to keep more pets and bigger ones.
For a person who lives in a small house a small pet is often good. They could keep a bird or two as these are very interesting pets. They have brightly colored feathers and make nice chirping sounds. If you have a parrot it can even learn to talk, but it takes a long time to teach it to say some words. If a bird is too noisy then they could keep some cute animals like mice, gerbils or hamsters. These are all nice and fluffy so you can take them out of their cages and play with them. Fish are also a type of pet for people without much space or time. They just need some food and their bowl or tank cleaning sometimes.
People that have more space and time to look after a pet could keep something bigger that needs more care, such as a dog or cat. Cats do not need to be looked after as much as a dog, but they get lonely if there is no one there with them. They often like to have someone to sit with and who strokes them. This makes them happy and they start to purr. If someone has a dog they need to take it out for walks so that it can get exercise. It is good to take a dog out twice a day. Dogs need exercise so they cannot be kept in the house all the time.
There are then pets that need a very large amount of space. These would be animals such as horses or donkeys, it could even be a domestic pig. For these animals a person needs more than a big garden, they need a field so the animal has space to move and run around, as well as grass to eat. These are types of animals that would generally not come into the house and the owners would only spend part of the day with them.



Weather in the UK
The weather affects everyone, and everyone has something to say about the weather. This is especially true in a country like the UK that has very changeable weather. In the UK the weather from one day to the next can be completely different, or even from the morning to the afternoon. The weather can change from being rainy one day to sunny the next, or from strong wind and gales in the morning to snow in the afternoon.
In the UK there are four seasons, spring, summer, autumn and winter, and the weather is different in each of them. However, there is not a sudden change between the seasons. The end of the winter season is the same as the start of the spring season. It takes several weeks for the weather to change enough for people to notice the difference.
The summer is the season with the best weather. In general, it is hot and sunny with only a little rain sometimes. However, it can sometimes be cold and wet for one or two weeks at a time. British people like to spend a lot of time outside when it is nice in the summer. After the summer is the autumn. In this season the weather gets colder and there are stronger winds, also it will rain more. All the leaves will start to fall off the trees as it is cold. Frost might start to form on the ground towards the end of the autumn.
Winter is the coldest season in the UK. The temperature will often be at zero degrees Celsius. This means that ice will often form on the ground overnight where there were puddles. This makes it difficult to walk sometimes. There might also be snow, but the UK does not get much snow, mainly just cold rain in the winter. Then when winter ends the spring starts. The temperature will start to get warmer and the winds will not be as strong. Plants start to grow again and new leaves form. It is always nice when the spring starts as it means the nice weather in the summer is nearly back again.
Many people in the UK complain about the weather, but as the weather changes so much it is very interesting and gives the people something to talk about all year round.



Shopping
Shopping is a necessary part of life which very few people can avoid. It is a daily routine for some people. Some people shop for pleasure while other people go shopping just to buy the necessary items in order to survive. The weekend is usually a good time to go shopping because people have free time from work. At this time the shops are usually very busy because people try to get the best items for the lowest price before the item runs out of stock. 
Some people go shopping more regularly than other people to browse products in shops even when they do not have much money. This is known as window shopping and allows people to plan ahead and save for the things they want to buy in the future or wait for the items to drop in price. Some people spend a lot of time looking for bargains while others do not think of the price and are happy to spend a lot. Some people believe that the more expensive the item, the better the quality, but this is not always true. It is sensible to buy items which are affordable, but some people use a credit card or borrow money from the bank so that they can buy the items they really want rather than wait for it.
Sometimes shopping can be stressful when choosing a gift to buy other people for a special occasion. It is common to buy a gift voucher so that a friend or loved one can go shopping themselves at their own convenience. Shopping online is often popular with people who have a busy lifestyle. People are able to order their necessary and luxury items from the comfort of their own home, or even on the move. Delivery is usually free and items are often cheaper than in shops on the high street. The only real problem is that the item description and quality may be different than what they hoped for. This could mean the customer may become disappointed with the item they receive and will need to return it at their own cost. People who go to shops to do their shopping often use self-service payment machines. This usually saves time as the shopper does not need to join a long queue. However, it can be frustrating when the machine has a problem and the sales assistant is not always available to help.



Travel
Travel is something which people do every day. It is very difficult to avoid the need to travel. It may be a trip to school, university or to work. Travelling can often take a long time, especially when great distances need to be covered. People often enjoy travelling abroad for holidays. But for some people travelling is not fun at all. Some people suffer from travel sickness. This means that they will become very unwell each time they travel. 
Travelling can be either affordable or costly. It often depends on how far you want to travel and the choice of transport. Using a bicycle will not cost anything as you power it by using your legs. However, the use of a bicycle can be hard work and can take a lot of time to travel long distances. Cars and motorcycles are faster modes of transport, but are more expensive to use as gasoline is needed for them to work. It can usually be assumed that the longer you wish to travel, the more expensive and time consuming it will be.
The use of a plane is necessary for people wanting to travel very long distances. A pilot will fly a plane from an airport for many thousands of miles to take people to places far away. Although traffic is rarely a problem for airplanes, it can take a lot of preparation to travel by plane. People often need to arrive at the airport three hours prior to departure. 
A train is another mode of transport which is ideal for travelling long distances within the same country, or between countries which are connected by land. A train driver will stop at train stations on route to allow passengers wishing to proceed to the scheduled destination to board the train.
A number of destinations can be travelled to by using the sea. People often depart from a harbour in a ferry which is driven by a captain. If the journey is a long distance, people may choose to sleep on the ferry while they wait to arrive at their destination. Some people choose to go on a cruise for their holiday, which would involve stopping at many different city ports for a short amount of time. People who need to travel short distances may choose not to use any transport at all. People often rely on their legs to take them to places nearby. This is often encouraged as certain modes of transport have been said to produce harmful emissions and damage the environment. 



Clothes
Clothing is something we all should wear in order to fit in to society. The act of wearing clothing is a choice in some indigenous societies while in a more modern culture you could find yourself in trouble with the police if you choose not to wear clothes. Clothes are easily accessible and can be bought in most high street shops. Supermarkets are also beginning to sell clothes. Clothes are for keeping people warm or serving as protection from the strong burning sun. Certain items of clothing can be expensive, especially if it is made by a well-known brand or is a particular design. While clothing is affordable for most people, the price usually depends on the quality of the material used to make the item and its brand name. In most countries clothing is taxed, while food is not. This is probably because clothing can be considered as a luxury item, especially if it is of very good quality.
The type of clothing that is worn usually depends on the occasion. People that attend a wedding usually wear formal clothes. Men often wear suits and women wear dresses. Formal and smart clothing is often worn in times of celebration. People often wear different clothing at work. Some jobs require people to wear a special uniform which should be worn by all employees. A pilot, doctor or air hostess may be required to wear a uniform so that all the staff can be easily recognized. Other jobs are less strict and may allow people to wear casual clothes. Construction workers are usually asked to wear protective clothing, especially when the site is considered highly dangerous. 
People often choose to wear comfortable clothing inside their own home. This choice of clothing may be very different to the clothing they would normally wear outside. Some people even stay in their bedclothes all day on the weekend when they plan to relax and not go anywhere. People often wear clothing which matches their current state of health or their age. Pregnant women are likely to wear baggy clothes, while youths often wear tighter clothing to show their figure. Younger females often wear high heeled shoes while elderly people tend to wear more comfortable shoes which will allow them to walk with ease. 



Sport
There are many different kinds of sports that are undertaken by a wide variety of different people. Some people do sport for their career and other people purely do sport for enjoyment and recreation. Some sports, like cricket, require the use of a lot of equipment, while others need very little in order to successfully play a game in that sport.  Some people use public playing fields to play sport for free, while other sports such as squash, tennis, badminton and table tennis are usually paid for on an hourly basis in the comfort of a local leisure centre. 
Most sports are played with a round object often known as a ball. Some sports use more than one ball and snooker is one of the unique sports that make use of a number of balls while being played. The game itself is often controlled by an impartial individual known as an umpire in cricket and a referee in sports like football and rugby. Most sports have a duration of not more than a few hours, however some athletic tournaments can last for up to a week and a game of cricket can be five days in duration before a winner is announced.
Some people prefer to watch sport. This can either be done by going to a stadium, a local leisure centre, park or on the television. It is often cheaper to watch sport from the comfort of a person’s home than to visit the stadium or a special event. Some sports, such as football and cricket, are really popular in the United Kingdom but not in the USA. In the USA people often play basketball and baseball. However, most countries put aside time to compete in world sporting events such as the football world cup or the Olympics, which occur every four years.
Nowadays, people who suffer from any kind of disability are also encouraged to participate in sport and most sport equipment is adapted to suit the needs of a disabled person. This means sport is something that can be enjoyed no matter the physical ability of the person. The para-olympics takes place a week after the main event and it is equally popular. Participation in sporting activity is encouraged by doctors and at schools given the beneficial impact it has on the health of the individual that participates, and it is for this reason and the competitive nature of individuals that sport remains a very popular activity worldwide.



Legal Systems
In many countries the legal systems are very complex. This is because they have been developed over very long times. Every time that a new case is decided it can have an affect on future cases. This means that the people who work in legal situations have to be clever. They have to know and understand all the rules and precedents. A precedent is when a previous decision will have an effect on future cases as it was related to an important point.
There are many people who work with the law, such as solicitors or judges. A solicitor is a lawyer who spends most of their time advising their clients and preparing legal documents, such as wills or contracts for buying and selling houses. They need to be very careful and make sure that all the details are correct, otherwise their clients might lose a lot of money.
A barrister is a type of lawyer who works in court rooms. They will either work for the prosecution or defense sides. If they are a prosecution lawyer they are trying to prove that the defendant (the person on trial) committed a crime. They have to present evidence to show that the defendant is guilty. If they are a defense lawyer then they work for the defendant and have to show that the evidence presented is not enough to prove that their client is guilty and he should be judged to be not guilty.
Then there are judges and magistrates. A magistrate will hear trials about less serious crimes, while a judge’s will be about more serious crimes. These are the people who have to decide what punishment will be given to someone who is guilty. The punishments could range from a small fine up to a long prison sentence, and even a death sentence in some countries. The trial happens in the judge’s courtroom, so the judge is responsible for making sure the trial is run fairly and follows the law.
If a lawyer believes that a trial was not fair or there was a mistake in the law, they can ask for a new trial that will generally be hear by an appeal court where an appeal judge will be in charge. Often appeal judges will be the most experienced judges in a country, so they know a lot about the law and how to apply it.



Driving
Although people drive in all countries, the rules can be quite different between nations and areas. For this reason, you should always learn the laws before you decide to drive in a foreign country. If you are not careful, you can get into trouble, since the rules might be very different from what you are used to. For example, you can find some big differences in laws related to the minimum driving age, the appropriate side of the road to drive on, and mobile phone use while driving.
In the United States of America, people who live in Alaska may obtain a learner’s permit (legal permission to drive while being supervised) at the age of fourteen. This is quite different from the driving laws of Niger, where a person must be at least twenty-three years old to drive. If you are curious to know the minimum driving age in most countries, the answer is eighteen.
It may also surprise you to learn that not every country allows its citizens to drive, although most of them do. For example, women are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia no matter how old they are. Instead, they must have a male family member or hired male driver to travel by car.
Driving on the right or left side of the road also varies. For instance, in Great Britain, Cyprus, Australia, India, and Malaysia people drive on the left. However, in the U.S., Mexico, France, and Canada people are required to drive on the right. As a matter of fact, one country can have different driving rules for different areas. For example, people in Hong Kong drive on the left, while drivers in other parts of China use the right side of the road.
Other driving laws that are different between countries include those related to using mobile phones. In Japan, using any kind of mobile phone device is illegal, even if you do not need to hold the phone with your hands. However, in Argentina and Australia, drivers are allowed to talk on their mobile phones as long as they do not use their hands. 
You might also find it interesting to learn that some countries have very strange or unusual laws. For example, in the country of Cyprus, it is against the law to eat or drink anything while driving. Even more interesting is that in Germany, there is a famous road called the Autobahn, where certain parts have no speed limit at all!



What Fresh Graduates Should Know about Their First Jobs
For recent graduates, internships may become a stepping stone to full-time, paid employment. Before accepting an offer to work as an intern you should get some information about the company’s reputation of procuring their interns and decide accordingly. If they usually hire one intern but have tens of employees working day and night, it is better to look for other companies. The best place to have an internship position is an organization that gives you an opportunity to gain real work experience and develop your skills instead of using you as a cheap worker.
Another thing that should be considered is the size of the company. Sometimes bigger and more established organizations are better as they have a clear hierarchy and therefore it gives you a clear idea of your position and the job description and most importantly, it will be easier to get a mentor. Startups with only five employees are usually more flexible in terms of job responsibilities and therefore it makes it harder to define your position and get mentors.
After you choose a company, do a little research on the company including the people who work there. You can do a Google search and comb social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter   to dig deep about the company’s hiring managers and what they expect from a new employee.
Social media is also very useful to keep in touch with as many people as you can and build your network. Do not hesitate to maintain any personal connection you have because those connections could be the first ones who inform you about a new job opening or any vacant positions you can apply for. 
If you aim for a dream job, do not overlook an entry-level position just because it offers mediocre salary. Entry-level employees are more likely to be given room to grow and learn from their mistakes. They will also be able to figure out the job routines and get used to them when they actually get the position they have been dreaming about.
As your first few jobs might be very demanding yet less rewarding, remember to have fun and enjoy your life. Working overtime may not always be a good idea to accelerate your career, especially if you have to be more stressed than your seniors who earn bigger salaries. Setting the time for exercise and social life will make your life more balanced and stress free.



What a British Person Should Know When Eating Out in America
Eating out may be a simple thing, but for British people who have just come to America, it could be an experience full of surprises. Here are five main differences a Brit should pay attention to when eating out in a restaurant in America.
Ordering Drinks
The first thing a waiter would ask when you sit down in an American restaurant is whether you would like bottled or tap water. If you choose bottled, you will then be asked whether you would prefer still or sparkling. Soon, the water you ordered will be brought to you. Coffee and soft drinks will also be gladly refilled. The waiter will proactively ask if you want another coffee or coke. In Britain, water and soft drinks must be requested and they are not free.
The Service
Waiters in American restaurants are more pleasant and attentive. They are always chatty and often come to your table during the meal to refill drinks and check everything is okay. In England, waiters are less likely to frequently check on customers. If you need something, you can raise your hand and waive at the waiter or else, you will be left alone for hours.
The Menu
In an American restaurant, picky eaters can customize the menu to suit their exact preferences by reeling off special requirements and substitutions. You can order salad but without tomato or with a special dressing to accommodate your diet. There is a friendly atmosphere that encourages you to have exactly what you want and satisfy your appetite. On the other hand, people in England tend to order a meal with all the options that come with it. It is less common for them to complain about the food or have the waiter send dishes back to the kitchen.
Picking up the Bill
In America, a waiter will bring you the bill even though you have not asked for it. This would be seen as very impolite by British customers, as it implies that they are being hurried out of the restaurant. 
Tipping
Tipping in England is optional. You will tip if you are satisfied with the meal and service, which is generally about 10%. If you are dissatisfied, you do not need to tip and this is quite common. In America, a tip of 15-20% is generally mandatory. For American waiters, tipping is the main source of their income. Even if the service is bad you should still tip, but it makes sense to give a smaller tip.



Buying a House or Rent an Apartment
There are many things to consider when choosing to buy a house or rent an apartment. For example, you should think about space, finances, long-term plans, and even responsibility for repairs and maintenance. This is a big choice for any individual or family, one which requires careful thought in order to choose what is best for you.
Your financial situation is probably the easiest and simplest thing that you should consider. Whether you plan to rent or buy, you will probably be making monthly payments. But how much money can you afford to pay each month? The general rule is that you should spend no more than one-third of your monthly income on housing. In addition, this rule is followed by many apartment companies who require potential renters to show monthly bank statements to prove that they can afford to live there.
Another important consideration is your need for space. If you are a single person, an apartment will probably be the best choice. However, if you are married with children, you might prefer to buy a house, since they are bigger and usually include a yard, which is great for kids to run and play.  
One of the most important things to think about when choosing between renting an apartment and buying a house are your long-term plans. For example, if you are not sure whether or not you plan to permanently stay in your current city or town, then you should avoid buying a home. Many times people make this mistake and find that it is difficult to resell the house when they would like to leave the area. On the other hand, if you are positive that you will live there for the rest of your life (or at least for many years), buying a house might be your best option.
In addition to the above, you will need to decide if you are able and willing to take responsibility for repairs and maintenance. If you rent an apartment, things such as mowing the yard, pest control, and repairs will be taken care of for you. However, if you buy your own home, all of this will be your responsibility. Home repairs can be very expensive, so you should ask yourself if you have enough money to make repairs in case of an emergency. Also, things like mowing the yard may be easy for a young, healthy person but difficult or impossible for an older individual.



Taking a Trip
Traveling can be tricky for a newbie. If you want to take a trip to a new place abroad or which is far away from where you live, you may need to make a good plan in order to avoid troubles during the trip. So once you know where you want to go, you should decide when and how you are going to go there. 
Many people take a trip during holidays because that is the time when they can take a break from work or studies. Unfortunately, traveling during holiday season may not be a good choice as prices for flight tickets and hotel rooms are usually higher than the off-season period when tourism is not booming. If you have a limited budget, you may consider taking a day off work during the off-season when prices are lower and discounted. 
Your budget will also determine what means of transportation you are going to use. Taking a road trip might be cheaper, but you should be in good shape and prepare your car for a long trip. If you choose to fly, you may have to take public transportation to get around in your holiday destination. Whether you take a taxi, subway or bus, you should know where you are going based on the itinerary that you have planned before and make sure you know the routes and the fares.
Next, calculate your costs. What kind of accommodation do you want? If you take a road trip, you may prefer to stay in a motel. Hostels are cheaper, but today you can search online and find hotels offering rooms with low rates. If the costs are more than you can afford, make cuts where you can. You may cut expenses for eating out or even cut the trip short and get back before the holiday season ends.
Once you are exactly sure of where and when you want to go, how you will get there and where you are going to stay, make your reservations. You can book your flight and accommodation online and even many attractions have ticket sales online so you can skip the lines and enjoy the attraction right in. You may also consider taking travel insurance. You will have some protection in case you could not travel during the time your tickets are booked for. If you plan to travel internationally, keep your passport, travel documents, visas and similar items in one place to ease you in accessing them.
Lastly, pack light. Heavy luggage will only restrict your movement and cause discomfort. A few basic shirts and pants or shorts will do and roll them when packing to save room for souvenirs. 



How to Trace Your Family Tree Online
A family tree or genealogical tree is a diagram that shows the relationships between members of a family in several generations. Creating a family tree is a great way for children to broaden their knowledge about great grandparents and other family members who have passed away or who they have never had the chance to meet. For adults, it can be a way to learn about family history and how it has affected their present and future lives.
Tracing and creating a family tree can be difficult and complicated to do, especially if you do not have sufficient knowledge about your family history and only have a few old photos and documents. However, digital technology has made it easier for you because now you can access online databases and search engines and obtain the information you need within minutes. The key information that you need includes names (common surnames or family names), dates of significant events (birth, marriage, death, emigration) and places to locate records such as church registers.
You can start your genealogy research by building a skeleton family tree. For this purpose, you can go to various sites on the Internet. After you have done the basic family tree, it is time to dig deeper by going to more specialized websites that contain military or employment records, parish records or wills. In this phase, you need to be sure of what you are searching for. For example, if you look for the military records of your great grandfather, you should have his full name, date of birth and the forces in which he served. Here are some sites that genealogists often use to research specific information: 1) the National Archives site contains wills and naval records, 2) the Origins Network site contains apprenticeship records, military records and marriage indexes, 3) the Times Online site provides information about famous or notorious ancestors from 1785-1985 and 4) the CWGC site provides details of servicemen and women who died during the two World Wars.
Of course, not all information is available online and you should not expect to find your entire family tree in one place. You may still need to visit your local family history center and look at cemeteries, courthouses and churches for more information. You can also make contact with genealogy communities through their websites and ask for a piece of advice. You can use sites like Genuki and Cyndis List to consult on genealogy research and find valuable information, genealogical material and links to hundreds of other genealogy websites.



Halloween in Britain and America
The Halloween celebration originated from an ancient Celtic festival some 2,000 years ago in the area that is now Ireland. It came to America during colonization and the American version of Halloween emerged as the result of different European and Native American beliefs and customs being mashed-up. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Halloween became a holiday for community and neighborly gathering, and Halloween parties for both children and adults became the most common way to celebrate the day. 
Today’s Halloween traditions include trick-or-treating and dressing in costume. Trick-or-treat has its origin in All Souls’ Day parades in England, during which poor citizens would beg for food and families would give them pastries in return for praying for their dead relatives. The practice was eventually taken up by children who would visit houses around their neighborhood and be given food and money. On the other hand, the tradition of dressing in costume has both European and Celtic roots. At that time on Halloween, people wore masks when they left their homes so that the roaming ghosts would not recognize them.
Halloween’s main celebration is parties where guests wear horror costume to reflect the day’s theme. Among teens and kids, however, Halloween costumes inspired by TV shows and movies are more popular, such as pirate, spider man, batman, Disney princess and Star Wars characters. Party venues are usually decorated by various symbols associated with Halloween, such as pumpkin lanterns, witches, wizards, ghosts, spirits and characters from horror films. 
Besides attending or throwing a party, many people, especially young adults, like to visit haunted houses. Travel agencies and attractions see this as a business opportunity and offer special Halloween travel packages. The Universal Orlando parks in Florida America, for example, feature haunted houses and “scare zones” that last for weeks to attract tourists from other cities.
Halloween is said to be the second-largest commercial holiday after Christmas. In fact, Halloween has become an industry and grown significantly in the past decades. The Halloween costumes and symbols lead many stores and businesses to promote products with a Halloween theme, which makes Halloween today more commercial. Retailers sell Halloween merchandise while nightclubs, restaurants and bars offer the hosting of Halloween events.
Both in Britain and America, Halloween falls on October 31st but unlike in the USA, Halloween is not a major holiday in the UK. Schools, businesses, stores and other organizations are open as usual and public transport services run normally.



Christmas Celebrations in Britain
Every year in December Christians around the world celebrate Christmas to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. Besides Christmas Day on 25 December, Christmas celebrations in Britain also include the Advent (four Sundays before Christmas), Christmas Eve (24 December), the Queen’s message (on Christmas Day) and Boxing Day (26 December).
According to the church calendar, the Advent is the official beginning of the Christmas run-up. The Advent is marked by the Advent calendar and the Advent candles. The Advent calendar is usually a thin rectangular card with 24 or 25 doors and a Christmas scene behind each door. It is opened every day from the 1st of December until the 24th or 25th of December. On the other hand, the Advent candle can be a candle with 25 marks on it, 24 candles for each night from 1 December through Christmas Eve, or four candles for the four weeks before Christmas.
On Christmas Eve, some people spend the night carol singing, attending a midnight church service or going out to the pub with their friends or family.  For young children, Christmas Eve is the time when Father Christmas or Santa comes and brings them presents. Traditionally before going to bed, stockings are left out for Santa and in the morning the children will check the stockings for presents.
The main celebration, Christmas Day, is the time for gift giving and family gathering. The average family starts opening presents around 8am and then they sit down to breakfast. Afterward, they can attend church or cook a big Christmas dinner, which is usually served around 3pm or 4pm with the traditional turkey as the main menu.
Another ritual on Christmas Day is watching the Queen’s speech. The tradition began in 1932 by King George V and continues to this day. The Queen’s message is broadcast on television and radio and most people in Britain watch or listen to it while enjoying their Christmas dinner.
Boxing Day, which is observed on 26 December, was traditionally the day to open the Christmas box and share the contents with the poor. Today, Boxing Day is a bank holiday and is primarily known as a shopping holiday as many shops and retailers open very early and offer sales and deals.



How to Choose the Right University
Choosing which university fits your interests and academic background is an important decision that will greatly influence the success of your university study. In the UK alone, there are hundreds of choices and therefore you need to be strategic in making a shortlist of universities and narrowing down your choices into second and first choice. This involves weighing some factors such as your motivation and aspiration, your personality, your location, and your budget.
People attend university for different reasons, so ask yourself what you want from your target university and what you want to do after you graduate. Many people attend top universities because of the prestige without considering their choice of future career. If you have interest in a particular career, you should find universities with a better reputation for your career choice than others. With a degree from a university that is most respected in the profession you want to enter, it will be easy for you to get your dream job and you will be able to climb the career ladder fast.
Your personality types also play an important role in your success as a university student. A scholarly type student usually has self-motivation to work hard in order to ace exams and achieve high grades. This type of person will find comfort in a highly academic environment offered by top world universities such as Oxford or Cambridge. On the contrary, if you are not a type of person who can study for hours and getting top grades is not your main priority, you better go to a university with a more laid-back academic environment so that you will not be stressful all the time and can enjoy your life at university.
Coming home could be a good escape during your hard time at university, so think about the distance between your home and the target university. If you get homesick easily, you should not consider choosing a university outside your hometown or which takes more than a day to travel by land or water. However, if distance is not a problem for you, you might want to consider studying abroad, especially at a university whose reputation is better than the universities in your home country. 
Last but not least, calculate your financial ability, which should cover tuition fees and cost of living. Both vary across the country and different universities, so do your homework by doing some research in order to find out which one fits your bills. If you cannot afford to go to the university of your choice, you can search for financial aid in the forms of student loans, grant, or scholarship. Do remember that if you decide to obtain a loan, you have to pay for it after you finish your study.



Proper Beach Etiquette
Whenever you go to a public place, you need to behave so people around you will not be disturbed by your behavior. Going to the beach is no exception.  You can do anything to have fun, but still there are rules to follow.
Once you arrive at the beach, you want to find an empty space. Observe the location and try to find a spot with a minimum of 15 feet (4.6 m) from anyone who is already there. If you plan to stay until sunset, remember that the tide will come up at some point so do not be too close to the water so you do not need to move when the tide gets high. It is rude to expect others to move back for you or to get closer to them. If you cannot find a high water mark, you can check a tide chart or ask some locals.
It can be very windy at the beach so pay attention to where the wind is blowing before inserting your umbrella into the sand. Make sure the wind blows against the umbrella and insert it at an angle. This is to keep the umbrella in the sand so that it will not get blown away and hit other people.
Smoking is not prohibited outdoors, but the wind conditions can make smoke linger around people or travel for quite a distance. Unless you go to the beach outside peak times, you had better not smoke when spending time at the beach.
If you wear flip flops, do not get too close to other people’s towels while walking. This is to avoid the sand from being flipping onto their towel. What is more, when the beach is crowded, do not run on your way to the water. Sand flies when you run and it could flick everywhere.
When you want to play a game, go away from the crowds. Playing ball over peoples’ heads while they are trying to relax is incredibly disturbing. Also, people often try to take naps while sunbathing so choose games that do not make too much noise.
After all day at the beach, when you want to go home, never shake your towel too close to your neighbor and see which way the wind is blowing so that you will not blow sand into your neighbor’s face. In short, remember that people come to the beach to relax and your actions could spoil their day. So keep a distance from your neighbors, be considerate, and make less noise while playing.



Supermarkets
A supermarket is a large, mainly self-service retail store selling food and other household goods. This was originally an American idea that was introduced into Britain after the Second World War at the end of the 1950's.
The biggest outlets are Tesco, Sainsbury, Morrisons and Asda. The Co-Operative, Aldi and Lidl are also large retailers. There is a lot of competition between stores to encourage customers to keep coming back. To encourage loyalty, they offer loyalty cards. With each visit points are added to the customer’s account, and when a certain number of points have been collected, rewards are given. They may take the form of money vouchers to spend in the shop or reduced prices off certain items in the store. These cannot be used in the other supermarkets.
At the entrance to the supermarket there are hand held baskets or trolley baskets on wheels. If a lot of shopping is required, it is easier to put it in the trolley and push it along. Usually the first display in the shop is the fruit and vegetable produce. Not far from the entrance is a separate counter that sells tobacco, cigarettes and cigars. An assistant will serve you at this counter. Near-by newspapers and magazines are displayed. There is a service point space where customers with problems regarding purchases can get refunds.
To aid customers to find the goods they need the aisles are numbered. Also large signs hang overhead to tell the shopper where items can be found. Originally supermarkets traded in edible goods. They could buy these in large quantities, and so sell them at a cheaper price than small local shops that did not have the space to buy in bulk.
As well as fresh foods that are displayed unwrapped, for example, cheese, fish and cuts of meat, food is sold in sealed packs. There is important information on the outside of the wrapping. It gives lists of the contents, food values and allergy advice. Sell by and consume by dates are also on packets and tins.
Supermarkets sell products from factories with famous brand names but they also sell similar items under the store name. Often the Tesco or Sainsbury brand is cheaper than Heinz or Kenco brand. The displays on the shelf units are cleverly set out to direct the eyes towards the product that the store hopes you will buy.
In a store, goods are sold fresh, frozen, in tins, jars and packets, while drinks are in bottles and boxes. In a large shop customers can also buy electrical goods, kitchen goods, soft furnishings and pharmacy products.
After collecting everything the customers pays at one of the numerous checkouts.



Birthday Parties
After a 9 month wait, the day a baby is born is the most traumatic and emotional time in the life of any parent. It is a life changing situation for the family. The parents now have to be focussed on the nurture of this small infant. It takes precedent over their priorities. This is a commitment that lasts for years, until the child becomes independent and can look after itself.
As each year passes and a birthday comes around it is a time to celebrate and enjoy each important milestone. The baby's first birthday will not be remembered by the infant, but for the family it is a very happy time. As children grow older and learn to socialise with other boys and girls, the planned party causes great excitement. The child can decide who to invite, where to hold the event and what sort of food to prepare.
Busy pre-school children love lots of activity. Climbing, running and jumping is a way to use up excessive amounts of energy. A party in the garden, if the weather is fine, is ideal. Alternatively a local community hall could be hired. Some parents organise a visit from a children's entertainer, magician or puppeteer.
When school age is reached, party games are enjoyed. Pass the parcel is popular with parents as the children have to sit down in a circle whilst the parcel is handed from one person to the next. When the music plays the parcel moves around from hand to hand. The person holding it when the music stops takes off one wrapping. When the last wrapping is removed the lucky winner keeps the prize.
Music at parties is very important. Games such as musical bumps, musical chairs and musical statues are firm favourites. While another quieter game is spin the plate. The children sit in a circle and are given a number. An adult spins a plate or circular tin tray and calls out a number. The plate has to be 'caught' before it falls down. If it falls over before being grabbed, a forfeit is required, which maybe reciting a poem or singing a song.
In the early teenage years, girls may only invite girls to their parties as they become self-conscious and shy in the company of boys. However as the years pass, birthday parties become an opportunity to get to know your school friends and develop deeper relationships.



Types of Hotel
There are many types of hotel, big and small. Big hotels, which are part of a 'group', offer guests a standard that does not vary from one location to another. Hotels can be awarded 'Stars' if their facilities match the Tourist Boards specifications. The more stars, the higher the standards. There is also a 'Red Star' accolade awarded for excellent cuisine.
People expect rooms with ensuite facilities. There is also a choice of single, double or family rooms to book. Hotels in large busy cities often have triple glazed windows to help reduce the noise of passing traffic.
When you stay in a hotel, the facilities are reflected in the price of the accommodation. Many establishments have swimming pools, squash courts, health clubs, gymnasiums and indoor play areas for young family members. Some of these activities can be used by non-residents, providing they pay the subscription fee. There are hotels with golf courses in their grounds. Some have lakes that are offered to guests who wish to fish or take out a boat to fill their leisure time.
A good hotel with pleasant helpful staff contributes to making a holiday enjoyable and encourages return visits. Christmas cards are sent to regular guests from the hotel management. A varied choice of fresh food beautifully presented in a dining area with lovely views, all add to the holiday experience.
If the guests do not wish to dine in the restaurant, room service is an alternative. A menu is supplied in the room from which guests can order. When the food is ready, a member of staff will bring it to the room. If the guests have to leave early in the morning before the dining room is serving breakfast, an order can be placed the night before leaving and breakfast will be delivered to the room at the desired time. There is always a list of the restaurant opening times in the room.
Most hotels ask their guests to vacate their rooms by 10 o'clock on the day of their departure. This is so the staff have enough time to clean the room, make up the bed and generally tidy the area, before the next occupants arrive. New visitors to a hotel do not usually have access to their room until after mid-day.



Advantages of Living in a Big City
Do you live in a big city? It is said that living in big cities is expensive because of the high living cost. There are also pollution and traffic problems that make living in big cities unpleasant. However, many people enjoy living in big cities because they offer convenience and countless options for entertainment.
Many big cities already have good public transportation systems, which make it easy for the citizens to go anywhere around the city. This also reduces and helps overcome the problem of traffic jams that often occur at peak times. With the convenience of public transportation, the citizens do not have to drive everywhere and can save money as they do not have to pay for parking charges.
Staying healthy is everybody’s concern and in big cities you can find the best possible medical care for any diseases, especially the severe ones. Moreover, compared to rural areas, access to medical treatment is easier because there are always clinics or medical centers that open 24 hours in many parts of the city so you can get medical help anytime, as soon as you need it. Reaching hospitals is also easier as public transport is usually available 24 hours a day.
There is a saying that big cities never sleep. This is true for some cities in which the nightlife begins just when people in other cities are ready to go to bed. Big cities like New York, Madrid, London and Paris have vibrant nightlife. People can still find entertainment, dine out or go shopping into the early hours. 
City dwellers are usually more diverse and there are many communities that hold social events or parties, which provide interesting opportunities for social interactions and social networking. The social interactions allow you to learn about other cultures and share interests with people from different backgrounds, which makes you more open minded and able to understand individuals. On the other hand, the social networking helps you to broaden not only personal but also professional relationships.
All in all, living in big cities is more convenient because of the complete facilities provided. The advanced transportation system enables the citizens to access public facilities easier, cheaper and faster. Big cities also provide better education and health service. In addition, city life is more fun and exciting because there is a wide range of entertainment to enjoy and a lot of social events to attend. 



Differences between People
People differ physically from the moment of conception, but it is only after birth that an individual can be observed. Family traits and characteristics are noted by adoring parents who think the baby looks like another family member or definitely takes after the mother's side or, without a doubt, has his father's nose.
Eye colour, skin colour and the texture of our hair are all different and depend on our inherited genes. A baby born with ginger hair may in a few months’ time have fair hair as the birth hair falls out and is replaced. Hair can be fine, thick, straight or curly, and as we grow older it gets thinner. Some hair loss is experienced at quite an early age whilst others have a full head of hair throughout their lives. People with dark hair may find that it turns to grey or white even before they reach their 40's.
European people in general have paler skin than if your ancestors come from Africa or Asia. Skin can change colour if exposed to sunlight, but the tan does not last unless it is regularly topped up.
The rate at which we develop and grow is variable. Boys and girls of the same age show big differences in growth spurts especially when puberty is reached. At the age of 12, girls are much taller than boys of the same age, but at 16 years of age, boys shoot up and overtake the girls in height and body strength.
The way the body develops is not just a result of physical changes, as our mental processes have a large part to play in what we want to achieve. A desire to become a skilful footballer, a long distance runner or a strong swimmer require stamina and years of practise to try and attain the top level. Even with hours of body building activities and work-outs in the gym, a person will not be able to compete in a Strong Man competition if they have a small frame and fragile bones.
The food we eat will, to a certain extent, determine how we grow and gives us strong bones. A lack of activity and eating too much sweet sugary food can result in people gaining excessive amounts of weight. It seems unfair that one person can eat all sorts of fattening food and not put on weight whilst others just 'looking at a cream cake' can put on pounds or kilos.



Modern Cooking
We all need to eat to keep fit and healthy. Young children cannot grow tall and strong unless they eat a well-balanced diet. This means a selection of foods that provide protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins and mineral elements.
Some foods can be digested raw but other foods are heated and cooked to make digestion faster. Salad leaves, cucumber, tomatoes, vegetables such as carrots, and fruit do not need cooking. However apples are an example of fruit that can be eaten raw and also cooked. Stewed apples, apples baked in the oven and apples in pies and topped with crumble are ways of eating the fruit. When food is cooked, it is heated.
Before people had electricity and gas, they cooked on wood and charcoal fires. A fairly recent addition to cooking is the microwave. This speeds up the cooking time. Fan ovens are also more efficient. Barbecue cooking outside in the garden on a warm day in summer, is very popular. In the kitchen, utensils are used to contain the food, and they vary from open pans to pans with lids, frying pans, steamers, pressure cookers and woks.
Before supermarkets sold ready cooked meals that just require re-heating, it was the tradition that men left the women in the home to prepare and cook food. Now both men and women share the tasks in well-designed kitchens. In restaurants, the chef, a few years ago, was nearly always male. Today however, there are as many female chefs as men.
There has been a great revival in the way food is cooked, mainly in part due to seeing a lot of cooking programmes on television. These are often presented as competitions like Master Chef and the Great British bake-off. Also people travel more to foreign countries and return home with exotic and interesting recipes. The availability of ingredients in the supermarkets also encourages experimentation.
The kitchen is now the 'hub' of the house. The family, friends and visitors when waiting for a meal to be prepared all gather in the kitchen and help to prepare the dishes or watch others doing the cooking. The utensils available to aid the food preparation are plentiful. Different types of knives for example. Aprons and oven gloves help to protect us from spills and heat when taking hot dishes from the oven. 
Some people love cooking, planning the meal, assembling the ingredients and then preparing the food. Others however prefer to open a tin of food and hot up the contents.



Going to School in the UK
In Britain children start school in their fifth year. Some are nearly five whilst others have already reached their fifth birthday. The first class known as reception and, for some children, it is a daunting experience. Five year olds love to be physically active and move around, run, jump and dash about all day. When they are in a group of 20 or more, they have to learn to follow instructions from the adult in charge. Sit down, listen and take turns is an unfamiliar situation.
Once a child has settled into the reception class, the first year is usually a very happy one. Lots of new skills are introduced. Communal activities and socialising with the other children, learning to take turns, these are all part of the first year experience.
As they paint, draw, bake, mould and enjoy sand and water play, they interact with other children and language skills develop. When they have music and movement lessons or activities in a gym, they learn to control their body movements as they stop, balance, roll-over, stretch and step slowly. Children learn to co-operate with others. In music, they have to listen for a rhythm and try to copy it using percussion instruments and join in simple tunes singing the melody.
Sitting down and listening to stories and answering questions about the story are all skills that are introduced and learnt in a child's first year at school.
Breaks in the school day, play times, can be shared with older children who are also playing at the same time. Chasing, catching, hiding, using balls and skipping ropes, falling over and getting back up, all help to get rid of pent-up energy. In some play grounds, lines and numbers are painted on the ground. Children can jump and skip along the lines and into spaces. Sometimes there are climbing frames to explore.
If a child does not go home for a meal at lunch time, the school provides hot and cold food to be eaten in the dining hall. Alternatively, a packed lunch can be brought from home.
In primary schools, the mornings are normally devoted to number work, reading skills and recording. The afternoons are less formal and more creative. Young children love dressing up in costumes and acting out adult situations. They have 'pretend' tea parties, make little cakes from plasticine and pour cups of tea for those involved.
At the end of a busy day, young children are ready to go home with a parent and tell them all about their day at school.



A new baby
Every baby has a unique personality from the day it is born. There are books available, giving advice to first time parents, explaining how a baby develops physically. These books can be helpful but may also cause unnecessary anxiety if taken too literarily. All children develop differently. There are lots of well qualified paediatricians to advise if a baby does not seem to be growing as quickly as other babies of the same age.
During the first months of a baby’s life, some mothers try to create a daily routine, feeds given only at specific times. However, not all babies co-operate and mothers may find a 'feed on demand' system better. Very small babies need milk more frequently than larger children that manage to drink more milk at each feed. A happy baby usually sleeps in between feeds. However some small babies prefer human contact and want cuddling and holding.
From an early age they are aware of movement, shadows, noise, human voices and can focus on mobiles hung above their cots. As the weeks pass and development continues, facial expressions become noticeable. Parents love to see the first smiles. Arms and legs get stronger and little fists grasp small objects. The head is very vulnerable and needs support all the time when picking up and carrying a baby.
From birth some babies have a placid disposition. They wake up gurgling, smiling and make happy 'singing' sounds. Others wake up and attract attention by loud cries, distressful sounds and lots of tears. As soon as mother appears, the baby stops crying.
This is an exhausting time for parents, as they only manage to get a limited amount of sleep. Small infants can be very 'selective' and if picked up by someone, not their mother, they will not stop crying. Strangers, well meaning, just will not be able to comfort and reassure the infant, however hard they try.
Parents are advised to put mittens on a baby, even if the weather is warm, as inadvertently, babies can scratch their faces with sharp finger nails. It is also advisable to keep a young child away from direct sun light. The best place for the pram in the garden has to be carefully chosen. A net is a good object to have as it stops flies and other insects from landing on the babies face.
One of the many joys for the parents with a new born baby, is the amount of interest the child attracts and the joy it gives to friends and neighbours, even total strangers.



Politics in the UK
The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, which means that the Queen is the head of state but she does not actively participate in politics. The British people vote for the members of parliament and they make the laws and run the country for the Queen. The Queen the signs all the laws passed by the politicians but she does not have any responsibility for saying what the laws should be about.
The political leader of the UK is the Prime Minister, who is also called the PM. This person is the leader of the political party that has the most seats in the House of Commons. Normally in the UK there is one party with a majority in the House of Commons, which means they have more than half of the seats, that forms the government to run the country. Some times if one part does not have enough seats to form a majority it will need to form a coalition with another party, and they will run the country together.
The UK is divided into many different constituencies, and each constituency is represented by one member of parliament, also called an MP. Nearly all the MP in the UK belong to a political party. The two biggest parties are the Conservatives and Labour. There are then several smaller parties, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green Party, UK Independence Party (UKIP) or SNP (Scottish Nationalist Party). Some MPs may also be independents, which means they are not linked to any party.
Normally there are elections every five years in the UK. The polling day is normally a Thursday. When there is an election, polling stations are set up all around the country so everyone can go and vote. Everyone who is on the electoral register has one vote. Most people go to polling stations where they get a ballot paper. On the ballot paper there is a list of all the candidates that are standing for election, and the person needs to make a mark by the name of the person they want to vote for. When they have done this they put their ballot paper in the ballot box.
In the UK, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency is the winner. They get to go to London and become an MP in the Houses of Parliament. It is their job to represent their constituents and try to run the country in a fair and proper way.



New Year Parties
Most people celebrate the New Year, and many of them do that by attending a party. Some parties may be small while others will be quite big. Some parties will be at a person’s home while other might be outside in a city center. 
The simplest and smallest New Year parties are those that a single family will have in their own house. This is where the parents and children will just spend time together. Some years a family will spend time like this and then in other years they will go to other types of parties. Often the family at a house party will eat a meal together and then wait for midnight. While waiting they play games, watch television, or talk to each other. 
Another type of party will be where someone will invite a group of friends to their house for a celebration. This will be a bit of a bigger party, and depending on the size of the house ten to thirty people may attend. If there are not many people at the party they may sit down and eat a formal meal, while for a bigger party it will be a buffet where people stand up and help themselves to food. Often the people who come to the party will each bring something to share that everyone can eat.
The biggest parties that happen are public parties in the middle of some cities. For these parties, groups of friends will spend the evening and night outside, often visiting several different pubs and bars. They might have a drink in one pub and then walk to another pub where they will have another drink. When it is getting close to midnight most of the people will finish their drink in the bar or pub and go to some central point in the city. At this place there will be a big countdown to midnight and the start of the New Year. After midnight the people will then either go home or go to a nightclub so they can celebrate for even longer.
As people get older the type of party they attend may change. A young person may go out to a big city center party while an older person may just want to spend time at home with their family.

Taking notes
Mark: What’s the matter?
Clare: I’ve got a history exam on Friday and I’m worried I’ll fail it.
Mark: Why? You’re brilliant at history.
Clare: It isn’t difficult but I have to remember a lot of information. These are my notes from today.
Mark: Can I see?
Clare: Yes.
Mark: These aren’t notes! This is a full text!
Clare: What do you mean?
Mark: You don’t have to copy everything! ‘Notes’ are just a few words. You have to write the important words. You don’t need to write the extra bits. Look. King Henry the Eighth was married six times.
Clare: That’s important information.
Mark: But you don’t need to write all of those words. You can draw little pictures too. Pictures can help you to remember things and then you don’t need to write so many words. Look.
Clare: That’s so good! The crown is for ‘King’ and the ‘H’ is for Henry. That’s cool. Then the heart is ‘love’ and a number six … well that is ehm … six.
Mark: Yes. So look at these notes. Let’s test your memory.
Clare: King Henry the Eighth was married six times.
Mark: Exactly! Write notes like this, Clare. Then you won’t have six pages of notes, you’ll only have two or three!

Using colours to do homework
Girl: My presentation is about how you can use colour coding to organise your homework.
To start you need a few things from the stationery shop. This photo shows the things I use. They aren’t expensive. They are all cheap. I’ve got coloured pens and pencils, sticky notes, page markers, glue and folders.   
First, I choose a different colour for each school subject. The colour I choose has to be easy to remember so I make sure it means something to me. Maths is green because my ruler is green. PE is yellow because my trainers are yellow. 
Here is a photo of my folders. I use the cheapest kind and I add a coloured sticky note to the top and to the front. I keep all my notes inside the different folders. 
This is a photo of some more sticky notes. I wrote them in the library when I was studying. The blue notes are for history. My history teacher has got a blue car! The black notes are for geography. One day I want to visit the Black Sea.
This photo shows the pages I need to read for homework. I use two coloured page markers to mark where it starts and ends. Those blue ones mark the pages I need to read for history. 
Finally, this last photo shows my wall calendar. This green star shows I have a maths test on Friday. This pink circle shows I’ve got French homework for Monday. It’s pink because ‘pink’ is ‘rose’ in French … and the rose is my favourite flower.
Has anyone got any questions?



Weather forecast
News reporter: Here is the weather.
Weather reporter: Welcome to the weather forecast. Now, let’s see what the weather is like today. In the north of the country it’s very windy and cold. There is a chance of some rain too, so don’t leave home without your umbrella! The temperature is around 10º centigrade. In the east it’s rainy all day today, I’m afraid. There may be a thunderstorm in the afternoon. The temperature is a bit higher, at around 13º. In the west and middle of the country the weather is dry, but cloudy. So no rain for you, but it is quite windy and the temperature is just 10º. The south of the country has the best weather today. It’s cloudy most of the time but sunny this afternoon. The temperature is around 15º.



Work
A.
I work on Saturdays and in the school holidays. Saturdays are busy because that’s when everyone goes shopping. Our shop sells clothes and accessories for men, women and children.  I work in the children’s department. It can be crazy sometimes, but it’s fun.
 
B.
I work during my summer holidays when I’m not at university. Oxford has thousands of tourists in the summer, so it’s easy to find a job as a tour guide. I take tourists to visit the university colleges and then we go down to the river. We go along the river on a boat. The tourists love the boat trip, but last summer one tourist fell in the river! I love meeting people from all over the world.
 
C.
I like my job, but lots of people don’t like coming to see me because they hate dentists. Sometimes it’s very hard work, but it’s great to help people when they have a problem. It’s so important to look after your teeth.
 
D.
My job is very difficult, but I like it because I love flying. I fly planes that take people to different places on holiday. Most of the time I fly in Europe to places like Spain, Greece and Italy. The most difficult thing about my job is when the weather is bad. Snow and thunderstorms are the worst. The best thing is visiting different places.
 
E.
I work in a hospital in the city centre. It’s a very big hospital. I help the doctors with the patients. I give them their medicine and look after them when they feel ill. I love my job but I don’t like the uniform and sometimes I have to work at night.



Kevin and Maria
Kevin:  Is that your sister - the girl over there?
Maria:  Yes, that’s my sister Catherine. How did you know?
Kevin:  You look similar.
Maria:  Do you think so?
Kevin:  Yes, I mean, obviously you have different hair. Hers is blonde, yours is brown.
Maria:  And Catherine’s isn’t curly, like mine.
Kevin:  No, but your faces are the same.
Maria:  I don’t think so. Her eyes are a different colour to mine. Hers are blue, mine are green.
Kevin:  I’m not talking about eye colour.  I mean, the shape of your faces. Her face is longer than yours, yes, but you have the same mouths, and the same noses.
Maria:  I don’t think I look like her. She’s much slimmer than me.
Kevin:  Maybe, but she isn’t any taller.
Maria:  No.
Kevin:  Are your personalities the same?
Maria:  No! We’re nothing like each other!  Catherine’s much more outgoing than me. She has lots of friends. I’m quieter.  I prefer my own company. She’s bossier too. I suppose it’s because she’s older than me.
Kevin:  You must have some things in common.
Maria:  Well, we both like music, and the countryside, and we’re both independent.  I suppose we have those things in common. What about you? Do you have a brother or a sister…?

Free Time
Richard: Hey Molly, do you want to meet up this weekend and do something?

Daily Routine
Hi! I’m Mo, and I want to say a big hello to all you camp leaders. You’re going to have a really fun time this summer at Canyon Falls. But it’s going to be hard work! So enjoy these two days before the kids arrive!
Now, first I want to talk to you about a typical day here at Canyon Falls summer camp. The wake-up call will be at seven thirty every morning. You’ll hear a bell outside your cabin. When you hear the bell, wake up the kids in your cabin. There are twelve kids in each one. They need to wash and dress before eight. At eight o’clock, we’ll meet in the field and we’ll raise the flag.  Breakfast is at eight fifteen every day in the big tent. At a quarter to eight, the kids return to their cabins and tidy up. There is an inspection every morning at nine fifteen. At inspection we will check that the cabins are clean and tidy, so the children need to make their beds, tidy away their clothes and sweep the floor before that time.
At half past nine the first activity session will start. There are four activities every day. These are small group activities - normally between 15 and 20 kids in each group. The first session is from half past nine until half past ten. Then there will be drinks and snacks in the big tent in the field. Session 2 is from ten to eleven until twelve. Then we give the kids half an hour free time before lunch.  Lunch takes between half an hour and forty-five minutes. We usually sing a few songs after lunch. Then the kids have free time until half past two, and then the third activity session starts. This goes on until half three, when there are more drinks and snacks, and the final activity session runs from ten to four until ten to five. Then there’s free time until six, and then it’s time for dinner.  In the evening we have an evening activity from seven until eight thirty. Something like a talent show or a baseball game. These aren’t in small groups, everyone in the camp joins in the same activity. Then you will go back to the cabins with your kids and you will spend some time with them doing something quiet - reading a story or playing a game, or just chatting together. At nine o’clock, the kids get ready for bed, and they need to be in bed by nine thirty. On some days you will be on duty until ten o’clock. This means you will stay outside the cabins and the children can come to you if there’s a problem. If you’re not on duty, you can go to the big tent and spend time with the other leaders. Please be in bed by eleven, because the next day is always busy. 



Shopping
Robert: So, what do you plan to do today?
Anna: Well, I’d like to go shopping. I want to buy some gifts for my family. Where is the best place to go?
Robert: Well, what would you like to buy?
Anna: I’m not sure, exactly.  Maybe some nice marzipan for my Mum.  And my Dad would like some German wine. Is there a supermarket?
Robert: Yes, there is, but you should go to the market.  It’s an indoor market. It’s open every day. There are some great bakeries and a great delicatessen. You can buy some nice food there. It’s better quality than the supermarket.
Anna: Okay, that sounds good.  And I need something for my sister too.
Robert: There is a nice jeweller’s near the market. You will find some nice gifts there.
Anna: Oh yes, I remember it. Next to the lovely florist’s.
Robert: That’s right.
Anna: Great. And is there a toy shop? I’d like to buy a game for my brother.
Robert: No, sorry, there aren’t any toy shops here. But you can buy toys at Hauffman’s. That’s a department store.  It’s in the centre of town.
Anna: Good idea, I’ll try that.  Oh, is there a pharmacy near here?  I need some sun cream.
Robert: Yes, there’s a pharmacy at the end of this street, next to the post office.
Anna: Great.
Robert: Actually, can you buy some things for me while you are in town?
Anna: Sure. What do you need?
Robert: Could you get some chicken for dinner tonight?  There’s a butcher’s in the square at the end of the street.  It’s opposite the newsagent, where we went yesterday. And there’s a greengrocer’s there, as well. Can you buy some potatoes, some carrots and some apples?
Anna: Sure. No problem.
Robert: I’ll give you some money.  Ah – no, I don’t have any. I need to go to the bank. I can go there later.
Anna: Don’t worry, I’ll buy them.
Robert: Are you sure?
Anna: Of course.
Robert: Thanks very much!



Weather
James: Look at that sky - what beautiful colours. Red - orange - yellow… it’s going to be a nice day tomorrow.
Lucy: Do you think so?
James: Sure. Haven’t you heard the saying - Red sky at night, Shepherd’s delight. It means that if there is a nice sunset in the evening, the next day will be fine.
Lucy: I’ve heard the saying. I didn’t know it was actually true.
James: I think it is.
Lucy: Well, there are lots of old sayings about the weather.  Not many of them are true.
James: What other sayings do you know?
Lucy: Well, there’s the one that says ‘rain before seven, fine by eleven.’
James: What?
Lucy: ‘Rain before seven, fine by eleven’… If it’s raining before seven o’clock in the morning, it will clear up before eleven o’clock.
James: Is that true?
Lucy: Not here! I’ve known it to start raining at five in the morning and still be raining at five in the afternoon! And there’s another one - if a cow is lying down, it means it’s going to rain.
James: Is that one true?
Lucy: No, I think if a cow is lying down, it means that the cow is tired!
James: Oh…what’s that American one - Groundhog day?
Lucy: Groundhog day?
James: Yes, it’s in February, I think. If it’s cloudy on this day, a groundhog  will come out of its hole. It means the cold weather will soon end.  But if it is sunny, the groundhog will see its shadow, get scared and stay inside its hole.  And that means it will stay cold for another six weeks.
Lucy: That sounds silly to me!
James: I don’t think it’s true, but it makes for a fun festival.
Lucy: Of course, in Britain we have a similar one about Saint Swithin’s day.
James: St Swithin’s day? I don’t know about that one.
Lucy: St Swithin’s day is in July - the 15th I think.  They say that if it rains on this day, it will be wet for the next forty days.  And if it’s sunny, it’ll stay warm and sunny all summer.
James: I bet that’s not true!
Lucy: No, I don’t think it is, but have you noticed that some summers in Britain are wet all summer long, while others are really hot?  We never seem to get something in between.
James: My aunt says Green Christmas White Easter - White Christmas Green Easter.
Lucy: Oh, you mean, if it doesn’t snow in December it will snow in the spring?
James: Yes, and the other way round too. If it snows at Christmas, it won’t snow in the spring.  It might be true. I’ve never really checked.



Bad things about home
Anita, Taiwan
What is bad about my hometown? I'm from Taiwan and I come from Taipei, and Taipei is a very big city in Taiwan but it's very dirty and the air is bad, the traffic is bad. I don't feel like living in Taipei, so that's why my mom and dad choose to live in the side city near Taipei.
Al, England
My hometown is called Stevenich and there's nothing I can say that's positive about my hometown. It has no green spaces, no cultural icons and really nowhere to go, so don't go there.
Barbara, Australia
One thing bad about my hometown, well, my hometown is Perth, in Western Australia, and I guess the only bad thing I can think of is the public transport system, the buses, they really don't run on time. There's not enough of them. The bus fleet is fairly old. That's really one bad thing about my hometown.
Jeff, Canada
What's one bad thing about my hometown? I live in a small little island on the east coast of Canada and there's not much there. There's not much entertainment. There's no restaurants. There's no movie theaters, so it's very quiet. Some people would say very boring, but I think you have to find other things to do like hiking or you learn how to play the guitar and play music and reading and writing so I think the bad thing about my hometown is there's not much to do, but it makes you create other things and do other things.
Mark, The Unites States
Something bad about my hometown? I guess for me something bad would be it's not very diverse. There's lots of white people and lots of black people, but that's about it. There aren't a lot of Asian people or Europeans or people of different ethnicities and I'm someone who likes New York or a more international type place, so I wish it were a little more diverse.
Simon, Canada
Vancouver? What's not good about Vancouver? Well, I think that the people of Vancouver overrate the city, and that's kind of, they think it's the best place to live on earth. It's the nicest looking city on earth. Yes, it's beautiful. It's a really nice place to live but it also rains eight months of the year and it's probably not the most cosmopolitan city on earth.



What´s good about your hometown?
Akane / Canada
What is good about your hometown? One thing that is good about my hometown, Toronto, is that it's a very multi-cultural city. That means that there are many different people from many different countries, all over the world, so I really enjoy going out and eating different kinds of foods from different places. YOu can have Thai food, Indian food, Chinese food, French food, Italian food, Portuguese food, all kinds of food, and I really, really enjoy that part of my city.

Barbara / Australia
One good thing about my hometown? Well, my hometown is Perth, in Western Australia. Ah, the best thing about my hometown is well, it's got a lot of parks and gardens and wide open spaces. We've got a beautiful river, the great outdoors. That's the best thing. You can really enjoy fresh air and sunshine.

Mark / America
My hometown is Birmingham, Alabama in America. I guess the good thing about Birmingham is it's a very friendly place. The south has a reputation for being friendly, and it's true, when you're there, people are generally very nice to you, and pretty much anywhere you go, even complete strangers will be nice to you, and we have a unique accent in Alabama, I don't normally talk that way but it's usually interesting for other English speakers to hear.

Jeannie / America
OK, so I'm from Philadelphia and I think the best thing about my hometown is the food, as Philadelphia is famous for the Philly Cheese steak, and also for soft pretzels, usually people like to put spicy mustard on them and it's a very good treat in the summer with Italian ice.

Naomi / Australia
My hometown is a very small town called Melanie, on the Sunshine Coast. It's located on top of the, on one part of the great dividing range of Australia so it's quite highly elevated mountain village. It has beautiful views of the Sunshine Coast, all the way down to the beach, and it's got a really nice sense of community being such a small town.

Ruth / England
What's good? Well,there are many good things really. I really like the people in my hometown, and I also like the fact that if you go shopping everything is really quite cheap and I can get to town really easily from my house. They are all really good things. On the other hand, sometimes it's a little bit difficult because there's really not that much to do except for that. The cost and everything is really good.



 



Pets
Hi, I'm Conrad and I'm going to talk about pets today. Let's start with the first pet. This pet is such a lovable pet. It will wag it's tail and lick you on your face when you come home.
The next pet is not as big as a dog but it's bigger than a rat. In fact, it likes to chase rats. It's very furry.
The next pet likes to swim. It swims around in a little bowl very fast and it will eat, and eat, and eat if you keep feeding it.
This next pet is a very slow animal. It walks and moves very slowly. It also has a very hard shell.
And our last pet is a cute little critter. It's furry and feels nice and soft to touch. Every day it exercises in it's cage.
And this pet loves to fly. In fact it wants to fly out of its cage but it can't. It makes very cheerful noises like 'tweet-tweet', 'chirp-chirp'.



Animals
Barbara, Australia
So, what is my favorite animal? Definitely cats. I love cats. I had a cat when I was a child. He was mostly black with white paws and the tip of his tails was white and he was dead cute and he lived to be seventeen years old which is quite old for a cat. I don't know. I just understand cats and I think they understand me. I love them.

Conrad, The United States
My favorite animal is definitely a dog. I can relate to dogs because I share similar characteristics such as being friendly, lovable, loyal and cute. Dogs also can do so many things to help make a person feel good. They're such giving animals and we have a German Sheperd at my parent's home in California and I really miss him now. His name is Yogi.

Lisa, Canada
What's my favorite animal? My favorite animal is a cat. If you asked me this question last year or two years ago I would say a dog, cause dogs are loyal and friendly and cute but two years ago I acquired a car and since then I have grown to find cats more intelligent than dogs, not so friendly but when they cuddle on you you love them more.

Phil, England
What's my favorite animal? My favorite animal is definitely a penguin because I think they have very much in common with humans the way they interact with each other and the way their life is very similar to human human relationships. They have one single partner for all their lifetime and they have one baby which they grow up with. They nurture and help to grow up. It's very, very similar to humans. OK, I also like monkeys because they're funny and very cute, but my favorite animal is definitely a penguin.

Adrienne, The United States
What is my favorite animal? Well, my favorite animal to live with is a cat, so for a pet I would say a cat because they take good care of themselves and they're easy to look after. You can leave them alone for long periods of time. That suits me very well, but I recently saw a movie called The March of the Penguins and I suddenly have a very big appreciation for penguins and how strong they are and how cute they are, really, so I think maybe penguins and cats.

Skip, The United States
What is my favorite animal? Well, the animal that I think is most interesting or that I try to... I don't know. I don't want to say live like but that I think about most is the wolf because I grew up in Minnesota and Minnesota in the U.S. has the only native wolf population in the U.S. and so that's usually kind of an image that I try and... you know, strong and independent, but works well in a group.



Rugby
Todd: OK, Kevin, I hear that you're from Wales.
Kevin: Yes, I'm from Wales.
Todd: And you're really into rugby!
Kevin: Yeah, I love rugby. Um, in Wales everybody plays rugby, in primary school, in juniorhigh school we play rugby. When I was in high school everybody in my high school had to play rugby. All the boys had to play rugby. And it's our national sport.
Todd: OK. Uh, do you still play now?
Kevin: Ah, I played about five years ago. I played in Japan in Kobe. The club was called Kobe Regata club.
Todd: OK.
Kevin: And they were very strong. Yeah, but in this country you play on sand, but in Wales you play on grass. It's a lot easier to play rugby in Wales.
Todd: Um, What's the best thing about rugby?
Kevin: Violence. Ah, it's very good because you can run and you can hit somebody and you don't go to jail for doing it so...it's the same as if you've been to America, the same as American football. Uh, it's very strong and when you practice you become stronger. You're body becomes stronger and it's just fun to play rugby.
Todd: Have you ever broken a bone or...?
Kevin: I've broken my nose, I've had about ten stitches in my bottom lip. Ah, I've broken a finger. That's not too bad. Many of my friends have broken their legs and knees... and problems but not too bad for me.
Todd: OK. Great. Thanks a lot Kevin.
Kevin: Thank you.
