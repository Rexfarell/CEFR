Hi Gina,
I've got three tickets - there were none for Friday so we have to go on Saturday. I'll meet you at the entrance at 6.45, OK? Bring me your ticket money tomorrow. Lucky that we're still at school - it costs less. Oh, and I'll get some drinks, but we'll need something to eat - can you bring snacks? Don't forget!
Ann
