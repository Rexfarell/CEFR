GLASTONBURY TICKET FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
HOW DO I BUY A GLASTONBURY TICKET?
Everyone aged 13 or over needs to be registered at glastonbury.seetickets.com. If you’ve been to the Festival before, it means that you are already registered. Go to glastonbury.seetickets.com at 9am (BST) on Sunday 7th October (tickets only). Tickets can be booked by paying a £50 deposit per person.
CAN I STILL REGISTER?
No, registration has now closed; it will reopen after the ticket sales.
I HAVE MORE THAN ONE REGISTRATION. IS THAT OK? WHICH ONE SHOULD I USE TO BOOK MY TICKET?
It’s OK to have multiple registrations (even linked to the same email account); however, we recommend deleting old registrations that you don’t use any longer. If you plan to book tickets for the Festival, please make sure that you are using a registration with your name and photo, and that the photo is recent and of passport standard.
You can request a list of all your registrations here (please note it isn’t possible to edit or delete your registrations while registration is closed).
HOW MUCH WILL TICKETS COST?
Tickets cost £248 + £5 booking fee per person, with deposits of £50 per person that you pay when you book the ticket. Children aged 12 and under are admitted free of charge.
Your ticket balance (£198 + £5 booking fee) will be charged in the first week of April.
HOW MANY TICKETS CAN I BOOK?
You can book up to six tickets per transaction, providing you have the registration numbers for everyone for whom you are booking a ticket.
HOW CAN I PAY?
UK buyers may use either a UK registered debit card or UK registered credit card.
International buyers must use a credit card (with a non-UK billing address).
