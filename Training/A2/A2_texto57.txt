Dear Colleagues,
This is to let you know that I will be on
holiday in sunny Malta for two weeks between
August 31st and September 14th. I will be
back in the office on September 21st although
you can reach me by email at this address
between the 15th and the 21st. In Malta I am
planning to be completely offline and enjoy my
holiday! I am taking my digital camera so I
will send you some photos when I get back.
Have a good summer, everyone!
With best wishes,
Julia
