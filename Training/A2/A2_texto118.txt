Daily Routine
Hi! I’m Mo, and I want to say a big hello to all you camp leaders. You’re going to have a really fun time this summer at Canyon Falls. But it’s going to be hard work! So enjoy these two days before the kids arrive!
Now, first I want to talk to you about a typical day here at Canyon Falls summer camp. The wake-up call will be at seven thirty every morning. You’ll hear a bell outside your cabin. When you hear the bell, wake up the kids in your cabin. There are twelve kids in each one. They need to wash and dress before eight. At eight o’clock, we’ll meet in the field and we’ll raise the flag.  Breakfast is at eight fifteen every day in the big tent. At a quarter to eight, the kids return to their cabins and tidy up. There is an inspection every morning at nine fifteen. At inspection we will check that the cabins are clean and tidy, so the children need to make their beds, tidy away their clothes and sweep the floor before that time.
At half past nine the first activity session will start. There are four activities every day. These are small group activities - normally between 15 and 20 kids in each group. The first session is from half past nine until half past ten. Then there will be drinks and snacks in the big tent in the field. Session 2 is from ten to eleven until twelve. Then we give the kids half an hour free time before lunch.  Lunch takes between half an hour and forty-five minutes. We usually sing a few songs after lunch. Then the kids have free time until half past two, and then the third activity session starts. This goes on until half three, when there are more drinks and snacks, and the final activity session runs from ten to four until ten to five. Then there’s free time until six, and then it’s time for dinner.  In the evening we have an evening activity from seven until eight thirty. Something like a talent show or a baseball game. These aren’t in small groups, everyone in the camp joins in the same activity. Then you will go back to the cabins with your kids and you will spend some time with them doing something quiet - reading a story or playing a game, or just chatting together. At nine o’clock, the kids get ready for bed, and they need to be in bed by nine thirty. On some days you will be on duty until ten o’clock. This means you will stay outside the cabins and the children can come to you if there’s a problem. If you’re not on duty, you can go to the big tent and spend time with the other leaders. Please be in bed by eleven, because the next day is always busy.
