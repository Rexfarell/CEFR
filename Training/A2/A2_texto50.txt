Charlie's Place
Charlie’s is a new American restaurant, near the subway on Fifth Avenue. It is open 365 days a year,
including Christmas. The prices are very reasonable – that’s probably why it’s popular with young people
and parents with kids. Charlie’s does good hamburgers and chips, but why are there hardly any salads or
vegetables? There is karaoke every evening from 10.00 pm to 3.00 am. It’s a relaxed and informal
restaurant and there are always lots of customers. Service is very nice, fast and helpful. Go there with all
your friends and have fun but not if you want to stay slim!
