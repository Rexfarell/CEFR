Learning to swim
a) Rachel Robbins: I learnt to swim when I was a teenager. I went to the local swimming pool with
my two sisters. It was old and cold and not very nice. I can still remember my instructor: his name
was Colin Firth, like the actor. But he wasn’t as good-looking!
b) Geoffrey Hopkins: It took me a long time to learn. I wasn’t a natural. I still don’t swim very well. I
certainly wouldn’t like to be in a boat in rough seas. I never really learnt to put my face in the water.
It hurts my eyes and I can’t see.
c) Simon Fordham: My father was a swimming instructor so I guess it’s in the blood. I can’t
remember a time when I couldn’t swim. I spent most of my childhood holidays at the beach and I
still go at any opportunity I get.
d) Karen Marks: One day I was standing by the deep end of the swimming pool and I suddenly fell in. I don’t know how I did it but I managed to get to the side. I was coughing but I could swim! My
brother saw me when I got out and thought it was very funny. But he didn’t laugh when I hit him.
e) Phillip Parker: I was on a small boat with about ten other boys. It was very small and someone
pushed me in the water. The water was very clean and I could see everything. I remember feeling
very peaceful and comfortable, I wasn’t worried at all. I started swimming, not very well, but
another boy helped me to return to the beach.
