Eden Hotel - Your hotel key card
To open the door of your room, put the card into
the door with the key symbol facing you. When
you hear the bell, remove the card and turn the
handle.
You can use your key card to get into the hotel
between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Put the card into the
hotel main entrance door with the key facing
away from you. The door will open
automatically when the bell rings. You do not
need to push the door.
We hope you enjoy your stay at the Eden Hotel.
