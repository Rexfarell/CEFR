Shopping
Robert: So, what do you plan to do today?
Anna: Well, I’d like to go shopping. I want to buy some gifts for my family. Where is the best place to go?
Robert: Well, what would you like to buy?
Anna: I’m not sure, exactly.  Maybe some nice marzipan for my Mum.  And my Dad would like some German wine. Is there a supermarket?
Robert: Yes, there is, but you should go to the market.  It’s an indoor market. It’s open every day. There are some great bakeries and a great delicatessen. You can buy some nice food there. It’s better quality than the supermarket.
Anna: Okay, that sounds good.  And I need something for my sister too.
Robert: There is a nice jeweller’s near the market. You will find some nice gifts there.
Anna: Oh yes, I remember it. Next to the lovely florist’s.
Robert: That’s right.
Anna: Great. And is there a toy shop? I’d like to buy a game for my brother.
Robert: No, sorry, there aren’t any toy shops here. But you can buy toys at Hauffman’s. That’s a department store.  It’s in the centre of town.
Anna: Good idea, I’ll try that.  Oh, is there a pharmacy near here?  I need some sun cream.
Robert: Yes, there’s a pharmacy at the end of this street, next to the post office.
Anna: Great.
Robert: Actually, can you buy some things for me while you are in town?
Anna: Sure. What do you need?
Robert: Could you get some chicken for dinner tonight?  There’s a butcher’s in the square at the end of the street.  It’s opposite the newsagent, where we went yesterday. And there’s a greengrocer’s there, as well. Can you buy some potatoes, some carrots and some apples?
Anna: Sure. No problem.
Robert: I’ll give you some money.  Ah – no, I don’t have any. I need to go to the bank. I can go there later.
Anna: Don’t worry, I’ll buy them.
Robert: Are you sure?
Anna: Of course.
Robert: Thanks very much!
