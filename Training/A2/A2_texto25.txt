Retail therapy
Retail therapy, or shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood is a myth, right? Well, no actually.
A recent study has found that shopping can actually be an affective way of decreasing feelings of sadness.
Researchers in the UK asked shoppers on their way into a shopping center to describe how they were feeling .
They (1) then measured their mood level again after they had been shopping. 
Those (2) who had been in a bad mood before they went in were found to have significantly raised their mood level by buying something to cheer themselves up.
The research was funded by business owners, who wanted to know if their store design was appropiate.
They (3) are pleased with the results, and are thinking about inviting the researchers to repeat the research in other locations.
