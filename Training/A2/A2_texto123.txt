Pets
Hi, I'm Conrad and I'm going to talk about pets today. Let's start with the first pet. This pet is such a lovable pet. It will wag it's tail and lick you on your face when you come home.
The next pet is not as big as a dog but it's bigger than a rat. In fact, it likes to chase rats. It's very furry.
The next pet likes to swim. It swims around in a little bowl very fast and it will eat, and eat, and eat if you keep feeding it.
This next pet is a very slow animal. It walks and moves very slowly. It also has a very hard shell.
And our last pet is a cute little critter. It's furry and feels nice and soft to touch. Every day it exercises in it's cage.
And this pet loves to fly. In fact it wants to fly out of its cage but it can't. It makes very cheerful noises like 'tweet-tweet', 'chirp-chirp'.
