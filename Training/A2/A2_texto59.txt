Welcome to Rudstone Walk...
Nestled in its own secluded corner of the Yorkshire Wolds, Rudstone Walk provides a relaxing retreat with
luxury accommodation for both leisure and business travellers.
Set in its own broad green acres and wooded hills with magnificent views over the Vale of York, it is no
surprise that this is a place guests return to again and again.
Owned and managed by the Greenwood family, Rudstone Walk has become renowned over the years for
its hospitality and highest quality standards.
For business it provides a peaceful retreat at the end of a working day - less than five minutes from the
M62, and 15 minutes from Hull.
