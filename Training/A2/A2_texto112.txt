Using colours to do homework
Girl: My presentation is about how you can use colour coding to organise your homework.
To start you need a few things from the stationery shop. This photo shows the things I use. They aren’t expensive. They are all cheap. I’ve got coloured pens and pencils, sticky notes, page markers, glue and folders.   
First, I choose a different colour for each school subject. The colour I choose has to be easy to remember so I make sure it means something to me. Maths is green because my ruler is green. PE is yellow because my trainers are yellow. 
Here is a photo of my folders. I use the cheapest kind and I add a coloured sticky note to the top and to the front. I keep all my notes inside the different folders. 
This is a photo of some more sticky notes. I wrote them in the library when I was studying. The blue notes are for history. My history teacher has got a blue car! The black notes are for geography. One day I want to visit the Black Sea.
This photo shows the pages I need to read for homework. I use two coloured page markers to mark where it starts and ends. Those blue ones mark the pages I need to read for history. 
Finally, this last photo shows my wall calendar. This green star shows I have a maths test on Friday. This pink circle shows I’ve got French homework for Monday. It’s pink because ‘pink’ is ‘rose’ in French … and the rose is my favourite flower.
Has anyone got any questions?
