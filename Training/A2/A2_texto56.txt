ASTRONAUT WALKS IN SPACE AGAIN
NASA Astronaut Jerry Ross works on the socalled “City in the sky” – the international space
station – and has just done a ninth space walk as
part of his 11 days on the space station. Ross is
the first person to walk in space so many times
and still loves the experience. He will be returning to Earth later this month.
