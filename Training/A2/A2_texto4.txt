Dinner Preparation
Montie's mother was coming to dinner, so he decided to get out the beautiful dishes she gave him. He looked forward to impressing his mother. He remembered how great he felt when she gave him the dishes. First, he got out his best silverware, cups and plates.
He carefully placed the plates on the table. Then, he laid a cloth napkin next to each plate. On the left side of the plate, he placed a knife making sure that its blade was facing toward the plate. On the right side, Montie placed the fork and spoon. After filling the glasses with ice, he put water in each glass. He placed white flowers in a vase in the middle of the table. They had a beautiful aroma.
As Montie stood back to admire his work, the doorbell rang. Montie had finished just in time because his mother had arrived.
