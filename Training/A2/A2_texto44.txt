Dear Sir/Madam
My name is Connor O'Sullivan. I was born in the Republic of Ireland and I lived there for 18 years. I am now 19 years old and at present I am at college from Monday to Saturday, so I can only work on Sundays. In my last job I worked as a kitchen porter at Mi Amore, Huntly Street in Aberdeen, but would now would like to work in a cafe.
Yours faithfully
Connor O'Sullivan
