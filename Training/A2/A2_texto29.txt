What things are important in my life?
Well, I’ve got an old car. It isn’t very fast,
but I love it. What else? Well, my mobile’s
very important to me. It’s got all my friends’
phone numbers on it, my photos, music,
everything! I haven’t got a laptop, but I’ve got
an old computer. That’s important to me for
school. And I’ve got a big TV in my room.
That’s very important because I love football!
