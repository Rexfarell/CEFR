Stop wasting time
Tom: I don't know what to do. I start off studying but I always end up doing something else.
Mum: I’ll help you but please listen to me.
Tom: Of course! Go on!
Mum: Now first, you need to take away all of the things that stop you working.
Tom: What do you mean?
Mum: First, turn off your music. Music doesn’t help you study.
Tom: OK. No music.
Mum: And put the dog outside!
Tom: What?
Mum: Well, every time the dog goes into your room, you stop studying to pat it. Spot stops you working!
Tom: OK. Bye, Spot!
Mum: Have an apple and a glass of water on your desk before you start. Here you are.
Tom: Why?
Mum: Because then you don’t need to go to the kitchen for something to eat or drink.
Tom: OK.
Mum: Turn off your phone.
Tom: No way!
Mum: Yes. It stops you working. If you turn it off, it’s easier to concentrate. You can read your messages later.
Tom: OK, but I can’t turn off the internet on my computer. I need it to look up information.
Mum: OK, but you can turn off your instant messages.
Tom: I know! Mum?
Mum: Yes?
Tom: Thanks.
