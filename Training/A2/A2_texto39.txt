An Irish teenagerÂ´s typical day
My name is Sean O'Brien. I'm fifteen years old and I live in Cork in Ireland. From Monday to Saturday my daily routine is always the same. My mum always starts at seven o'clock in the morning when I get up and wash my face. After that, I do some exercises, put my clothes on, and prepare my school bag. Then I go downstairs and have a breakfast with my mum and dad. I usually have sandwich and a cup of tea, but I never have sausages and eggs. After breakfast I always make my bed and then I go to school. I stay at school from eight o'clock in the morning till half past two in the afternoon. On Mondays and Wednesdays I stay later because I have drum lessons. On the other days I usually play football with my friends. When I get home I sometimes help my mother in the house. I usually do my homework from five o'clock to seven o'clock in the evening. At around seven o'clock we all have dinner together. After dinner I usually watch some TV and chat with my family. At 10 o'clock I read a book and go to bed. After such a busy day, I always feel sleepy and ready for my comfortable bed!
