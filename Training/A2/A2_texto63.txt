Self-catering
Self-catering cottages and flats are also available.
Built from a range of period farm buildings on a west-facing terrace where, on a clear day, the view extends
to 50 miles across the Vale of York and each warm summer evening ends with a spectacular sunset.
Turn your head to the left and there is another wonderful view over the glittering Humber Estuary to the
Lincolnshire Wolds.
The cottages and flats are beautifully appointed with every conceivable comfort including TV, microwave
and telephone - in fact to ETB 4-Star standards.
All linen, towels and tea towels are provided and changed weekly. Electricity and heating are included and
the laundry facility is free of charge.
