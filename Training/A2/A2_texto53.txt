Prince Charles gives money to school
The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, visited
a junior school in Buckinghamshire last week
to help children with a project about the Royal
Family. He told the children about his life as a
member of Britain’s most famous family and
the duties which go with his title. He then let
photos be taken of him with the children and
the teachers for the project work. One of the
questions the children asked was “How much
pocket money do your sons get?”
