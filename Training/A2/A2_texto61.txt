Something quite unique
Rudstone Walk offers something quite unique in dining and is the ideal venue for your special celebration,
or just a night out with a difference! Rudstone Walk offers a wonderful atmosphere, and we do specialise in
the typical farmhouse meal - all freshly prepared and cooked in the traditional way on the Farmhouse Aga.
For parties of 10 or more we offer you the exclusive use for your lunch or dinner of either the Farmhouse
Dining Room or Function Room.
The same menus are offered in both rooms. To arrange your dinner party simply contact us to check on
availability. We will need a small deposit to confirm your booking and will need confirmation of your menu
choices 7 days in advance of your dinner.
Choose from one of our Dinner Party Menus or get in touch with us if there is something specific that you
require.
