Taking notes
Mark: What’s the matter?
Clare: I’ve got a history exam on Friday and I’m worried I’ll fail it.
Mark: Why? You’re brilliant at history.
Clare: It isn’t difficult but I have to remember a lot of information. These are my notes from today.
Mark: Can I see?
Clare: Yes.
Mark: These aren’t notes! This is a full text!
Clare: What do you mean?
Mark: You don’t have to copy everything! ‘Notes’ are just a few words. You have to write the important words. You don’t need to write the extra bits. Look. King Henry the Eighth was married six times.
Clare: That’s important information.
Mark: But you don’t need to write all of those words. You can draw little pictures too. Pictures can help you to remember things and then you don’t need to write so many words. Look.
Clare: That’s so good! The crown is for ‘King’ and the ‘H’ is for Henry. That’s cool. Then the heart is ‘love’ and a number six … well that is ehm … six.
Mark: Yes. So look at these notes. Let’s test your memory.
Clare: King Henry the Eighth was married six times.
Mark: Exactly! Write notes like this, Clare. Then you won’t have six pages of notes, you’ll only have two or three!
