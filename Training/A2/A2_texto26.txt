7 tips for a tidy desk
1. Only keep things you really need on and near your desk.
Use a tray for any papers you have to read. Have a jar for pens and pencils and have a bin near your desk.
2. Don’t keep any drinks on your desk.
Go to the kitchen when you want to have a drink or, if you prefer, keep a drink on a small table near your desk.
3. Reduce the amount of paper that you use.
Try to keep as much information as possible in folders on your computer. Before printing a document, ask yourself, ‘do I really need to read this on paper?’
4. Scan your notes.
If you have a lot of paper (magazine articles, notes, worksheets, etc.), use a scanner and keep a digital version as a PDF on your computer.
5. Use your smartphone to take photos of things you need to remember.
For example, take photos of notes to yourself, the name and address of a place you need to visit or diagrams you need to study for school.
6. Get a noticeboard.
If you really do need to keep small bits of paper, use a noticeboard on the wall. Check it every day and throw old notes in the bin.
7. Clean your desk at the end of every day.
Choose a time to tidy your desk and do it! If you do it every day, it will only take five minutes and you can start each new day with a clean and tidy space.
