At the chemist
Chemist: Hello, can I help?
Customer: Yes, my wife sent me here. I, erm, need something for a sore throat … and I can't stop coughing. It really hurts.
Chemist: Do you have a headache too?
Customer: Not really, no.
Chemist: Well, we have this syrup. And these lozenges.
Customer: Which is better? 
Chemist: They're both good. The syrup is more expensive.
Customer: Oh, well … I'll take the lozenges, then. How many do I take?
Chemist: Just one.
Customer: Sorry, I'm sorry. Er, how often should I take it?
Chemist: Just one every four to six hours. Take it before mealtimes. Are you allergic to any medicine?
Customer: No.
Chemist: Then you'll be fine with this.
Customer: Can I get some antibiotics too?
Chemist: I'm afraid you need a prescription for that.
Customer: Ah.
Chemist: You know, you should really see a doctor if that cough continues.
Customer: Thanks. I know.
Chemist: Anything else?
Customer: No, thanks.
Chemist: That'll be £7.49 then, please.
