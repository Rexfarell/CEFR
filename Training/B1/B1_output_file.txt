Chicago
Keith recently came back from a trip to Chicago, Illinois. This midwestern metropolis is found along the shore of Lake Michigan. During his visit, Keith spent a lot of time exploring the city to visit important landmarks and monuments.
Keith loves baseball, and he made sure to take a visit to Wrigley Field. Not only did he take a tour of this spectacular stadium, but he also got to watch a Chicago Cubs game. In the stadium, Keith and the other fans cheered for the Cubs. Keith was happy that the Cubs won with a score of 5-4.
Chicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one of the few remaining landmarks to have survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Keith also took a walk through Jackson Park, a great outdoor space that hosted the World’s Fair of 1892. The park is great for a leisurely stroll, and it still features some of the original architecture and replicas of monuments that were featured in the World’s Fair.
During the last part of his visit, Keith managed to climb the stairs inside of the Willis Tower, a 110-story skyscraper. Despite the challenge of climbing the many flights of stairs, Keith felt that reaching the top was worth the effort. From the rooftop, Keith received a gorgeous view of the city’s skyline with Lake Michigan in the background.





Christmas
A Christian holiday signifying the birth of Jesus, Christmas is widely celebrated and enjoyed across the United States and the world. The holiday always falls on 25 December (regardless of the day of the week), and is typically accompanied by decorations, presents, and special meals.
Specifically, the legend behind Christmas (and the one that most children are told) is that Santa Claus, a bearded, hefty, jolly, and red-jacket-wearing old man who lives in the North Pole, spends the year crafting presents with his elves, or small, festive, excited Santa-assistants. All the children who behave throughout the year are admitted to the Good List, and will presumably receive their desired gifts on Christmas, while those who don't behave are placed on the Naughty List, and will presumably (although the matter is determined by parents) receive a lump of coal.
Santa Claus is said to fly around the Christmas sky in a sled powered by his magical reindeer, or cold-resistant, mythically powered, individually named animals, delivering presents to each child's house in the process. Santa is also expected to slide through chimneys to deliver these presents (homes not equipped with chimneys might "leave the front door cracked open"), and children sometimes arrange cookies or other treats on a plate for him to enjoy.
Gifts are placed underneath a Christmas tree, or a pine tree that's decorated with ornaments and/or lights and is symbolic of the holiday. Additionally, smaller gifts may be placed inside a stocking, or a sock-shaped, holiday-specific piece of fabric that's generally hung on the mantle of a fireplace (homes without fireplaces might use the wall). A Christmas tree's ornaments, or hanging, typically spherical decorations, in addition to the mentioned lights, may be accompanied by a star, or a representation of the Star of Jerusalem that the Three Apostles followed while bringing Baby Jesus gifts and honoring him, in the Bible.



Going to work in the morning
My job is a long distance from my home, almost 50 miles away. I have to wake up early every morning, as I’m always in a rush. There’s never enough time for a relaxed breakfast. At exactly 6:00 AM, I get into my car and start the long drive.
I usually like driving on the highway more than in the city. During the morning rush hour, though, it’s not very enjoyable. The heavy traffic is a little bit annoying. So I always listen to my favorite classical music CD’s in the car – Chopin, Mozart, and Bach. That cheers me up a lot.
The drive to work takes about one hour. Going back home in the evening after work takes even longer, maybe around 70 minutes. Lately I’ve been thinking about trying to take the train to work instead of driving. That way, I could still listen to my music with headphones, and even read a novel at the same time.



Halloween
Halloween (also referred to as All Hollows' Eve) is a holiday that's celebrated in America on 31 October of each year, regardless of what day of the week this date falls on. Although it is rooted in religion, Halloween today is enjoyed mainly because of its decorations, costumes, candy, treats, and general excitement, and furthermore, it is enjoyed by most everyone.
Before Halloween, many individuals carve a design into an orange-colored pumpkin, or a solid, durable vegetable. Once a personally satisfying design is carved, a lit candle is typically put inside a pumpkin, thereby making it a Jack-O-Lantern. At night, this design lights up against the darkness.
Besides carving pumpkins, some celebrate Halloween by putting decorations up. Supernatural (referring in this case to non-natural creatures that're typically based in fiction) figures, including vampires, ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and more, generally account for most of these decorations. Bugs, spiders, cobwebs, gravestones, and anything else that can be considered creepy (or unusual and possibly scary) can also be found on Halloween, in decoration form.
Only some adults celebrate Halloween, and they generally do so by attending parties. Inversely, the vast majority of children dress in costume (Halloween costumes can be based upon anything, from the mentioned supernatural creatures to the stars of today's films) and walk from door to door in search of candy—a practice known as trick or treat—on Halloween. After knocking on a door (houses that participate in Halloween usually leave a light on), one says, "Trick or Treat" and a piece (or pieces!) of candy is given to him or her.



Jobs and Professions
As has been the case for many years, jobs, or forms of employment wherein employees perform a service or duty in exchange for financial compensation, play a prominent role in society. Furthermore, all jobs—even those of seemingly little significance—are important, as they simply wouldn't exist if their specific responsibilities weren't of value to employers (companies or persons that pay others for their work), customers (individuals who pay money for a product or service), and the economy generally.
Teachers, or educational professionals tasked with helping students understand certain subjects and topics, are especially crucial today. In short, teachers help their students to become qualified for their future careers.
Doctors, or medical professionals who specialize in providing health-related assistance to patients, are some of the most respected individuals in America and the world. It's the responsibility of doctors to help those who feel less-than-stellar to determine the underlying health issue(s) and recommend an effective treatment (or remedy to a disease, disorder, or condition).
There are quite a few types of specialty doctors in America (besides MD, which simply means "medical doctor"), all of whom can be referred to simply as "Doctor (Name)." Dentists (mouth/teeth doctors), dermatologists (skin doctors), and psychiatrists (mental-health doctors) are just a few examples of the many different types of doctors.
Additionally, nurses are medical professionals who help to administer doctor-ordered treatments to patients.
Police officers are law enforcement professionals whose job it is to protect citizens, solve crimes, and assure that rules and regulations are followed. Similarly, firefighters serve the public by responding to fires (and other emergency situations) and using high-tech equipment to extinguish these fires, while bringing any individuals who're in danger to safety.
Farmers maintain fields of crops (or vegetable/fruit plants) and/or collections of animals with the intention of selling these products as food.
Chefs/cooks prepare meals in professional settings, including restaurants, cafeterias, and other venues wherein food and drink are sold, for customers. Chefs are generally experienced in cooking and managing kitchens.
Waiters bring menus, beverages, meals, and ultimately, the check (or a bill of the foods and drinks purchased in a transaction) to tables in restaurants and other establishments that serve food.
Artists produce art, or works of creative significance, including music, paintings, drawings, poetry, writing, and more.





Las Vegas
Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city. The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a visit to many popular cities worldwide. Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments. These famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Venice, and even ancient Rome.
One day, John took a side trip outside of the city to visit the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World. The canyon offers a breathtaking view of Nevada’s ridges and natural landscape. John especially liked the canyon because it was removed from all of the noise and movement in downtown Las Vegas.
John had a great time during his trip to Las Vegas. He did not win a lot of money in the casinos. However, he managed to see a lot of amazing sites during his visit to this city that never sleeps.



London
London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in the United Kingdom. The city is quite popular for international tourism because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies in the western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. They were very excited for their trip because this was their first journey overseas from the United States.
Among the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. Big Ben is one of London’s most famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at the northern end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne were only able to view the tower from the outside. The women learned that the tower’s interior is undergoing renovations until 2021.
Fortunately, the London Eye, the city’s famous Ferris wheel, was open to the public. The London Eye is situated along the southern shores of the Thames River. This attraction stands 135 meters high. It is one of London’s most well-known spots for gaining aerial views of the city. Each capsule of the Ferris wheel can hold up to 25 passengers. When their capsule stopped at the top of the Ferris wheel, the women took spectacular panoramic photographs of the beautiful cityscape below.
The last place that Rita and Joanne visited was Buckingham Palace, the home of the Queen of England. The women were impressed by the palace’s incredible architecture and historical value. Both Rita and Joanne enjoyed watching the Queen’s guards outside the palace. These guards wore red tunic uniforms, shiny black boots, and bearskin hats. Despite the women’s attempts to catch the attention of the guards, the guards are specifically trained to avoid distractions. Because of this, the guards ignored the women completely.
Joanne and Rita had an amazing time visiting the city of London, and they are inspired to seek more international travel destinations in the future.



Los Angeles
Stephanie recently took a weekend trip to Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is a coastal city situated along the Pacific Ocean. Many celebrities earned their claim to fame here. Although the town offers many attractions centered around Hollywood culture, there is a lot to see and visit in Los Angeles.
Of course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located the Hollywood Hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-studded town. Once in downtown Hollywood, it’s possible to take a stroll along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. This landmark contains more than 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have made a significant impact on the entertainment industry. In Hollywood, visitors can even take tours of popular movie studios. Stephanie had a chance to visit Universal Studios, which produces her favorite films.
Los Angeles is also a popular beach town, offering plenty of opportunities for sunbathing and surfing. A common beach destination is the Santa Monica Pier, which offers rides and attractions to its visitors. Here, Stephanie rode the iconic Ferris wheel, which offered her a spectacular view of the city and coast.
These are just some of the things Stephanie experienced during her visit to Los Angeles. She loved her trip, and she hopes to return someday soon.



Miami
Christina visited Miami during her winter vacation. She is from Boston, where it is cold during the winter months. Miami, however, has a very warm climate. There are many sunny days in Miami, and people can go to the beach all year long. Christina spent a good portion of her trip on the beach to relax and sunbathe. However, she also explored Miami and its surroundings.
Inspired by Miami’s proximity to the ocean, Christina visited the Miami Seaquarium to learn about marine life. There, she watched a show using trained dolphins, killer whales, and other aquatic mammals. She took a lot of pictures of the sea creatures jumping out of the water and performing tricks.
Christina also took an excursion to the Everglades National Park. This park is a protected area spanning 1.5 million acres. Because the park is mostly swampland, it is home to many reptiles. Native animals include snakes, alligators, and crocodiles. The park is also great for birdwatching. Christina enjoyed hiking the trails in the Everglades and observing the wildlife in its natural environment.
When Christina returned to the city, she visited Little Havana. This is Miami’s Cuban neighborhood. Christina could see that Little Havana’s people demonstrated a lot of pride for their Cuban heritage. There were many outdoor shops and vendors, live musicians, and the Cuban cuisine was delicious. Little Havana was Christina’s favorite part about her trip to Miami. This neighborhood made Christina feel like she had traveled to Cuba without ever having to leave the United States.



My city
My city isn’t a bad city however it’s nothing to get too excited about either. Because it’s a quiet city with very little crime lots of people move here to start families. There are plenty of schools and several parks. There are also quite a number of jobs. People work in both offices and factories.
Having grown up here, I know it well. Too well. I’m ready to move to another place. I want to see other cities and other countries. I think it’s important to learn new things and explore other cultures. I like to spend time with people who have ideas that are different from my ideas. It helps me to see things in a new way.



Plants
Plants are extraordinary living things. Although they seem simple, they are actually, in some ways, more complicated than us.
For instance, a whole new plant can be grown from just a single leaf. No animal can accomplish that! The way that plants distribute their seeds is amazing too. Plants can shoot seeds from their pods, send them flying on the wind, or grow spines that attach seeds to animals’ fur, spreading new generations everywhere.
Plants are also amazingly adaptable, finding ways to grow even in impossible environments, both hot and cold. Plants manufacture their own food from sunlight, absorb nutrients from the ground, and fool insects into spreading their pollen. Truly, they are some of nature’s finest creations.





San Francisco
In June, Diane visited her friends who live in San Francisco, California. This was Diane’s first time in the city, and she enjoyed her opportunities to walk around and explore.
On the first day of her trip, Diane visited the Golden Gate Bridge. This red suspension bridge measures 1.7 miles in length. Diane and her friends did not walk across the bridge. However, they viewed it from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which offers hiking trails, picnicking areas, and presents spectacular views of the bridge and city. Diane and her friends made sure to take a group photograph here, featuring the bridge in the background.
The next day, Diane and her friends visited Alcatraz Island. This island is located 1.25 miles offshore in the San Francisco Bay. It used to serve as a lighthouse, military fort, and prison. Diane and her friends took a small tour boat across bay to reach the island. Their visit included a guided tour through the old military base and prison. They also took a walk around the island to appreciate some of the native wildlife in addition to the views of the city.
Diane and her friends spent the final day of her vist in San Francisco’s downtown area. Diane’s favorite part of her entire trip was taking a trolley to transport her up and down the hilly streets of San Francisco. Diane did a lot of shopping downtown on her last day. She and her friends celebrated the end of her visit by having dinner at one of San Francisco’s best restaurants.





Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated predominantly in North America, and it possesses a different meaning in each of the countries where it's acknowledged.
In the United States, Thanksgiving is a federal holiday (meaning all government employees and most private employees are given a day off of work), and always takes places on the Fourth Thursday in November, regardless of the date.
The holiday signifies the immense progress made by pilgrims, or some of the first travelers to North America, at Plymouth Plantation circa 1621. It was at this time that the hungry and weary Pilgrims were taught (by Native Americans) how to grow and produce food on North America's unique terrain. Once they'd grown (and caught) an abundance of food, the Pilgrims were expectedly thankful, and they celebrated alongside the Native Americans who provided them with such valuable assistance. President Abraham Lincoln initiated the contemporary practice of Thanksgiving by calling for a "day of Thanksgiving" during one of his Civil War addresses.
In America today, Thanksgiving remains firmly engrained in its historical roots, and is widely considered to be a day for giving thanks for good food, good times, and family. Thanksgiving dinner generally consists of turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, vegetables, gravy, and ample desserts. To be sure, indulging in abundance is a cornerstone of the holiday, as doing so could only be possible if one possesses abundance.


 




The Empire State Building
When exploring New York City, there are several different options for activities during a day trip. Some visitors come to see a show, visit art museums, or simply to shop in many of the city’s high-end retailers. However, many tourists simply come to New York City for the sightseeing. One of the most visited landmarks in New York City is the Empire State Building.
The Empire State Building, constructed in 1931, is a 102-story skyscraper, the ninth highest building in the world, and the fourth tallest structure in the United States. It is located in Midtown, Manhattan. This skyscraper is an iconic symbol of the city, having been featured in over 90 popular movies (as of 2018) throughout film history. Tourists come from all over the world to visit this building and view the city from its famous observation decks.
Matthew, an enthusiast of historic buildings, was excited for this trip to New York City because he has always appreciated architectural design. Matthew purchased a ticket that granted him access to beautiful 360-degree views of the city. The ticket included an elevator ride that stopped at two different vantage points, one at the 86th floor and the other at the rooftop observatory on the 102nd floor. From these observation decks, Matthew took incredible photographs of the entire New York City skyline. The rooftop views granted Matthew perfect aerial perspectives of Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and many other important city landmarks.



The four seasons
The four seasons are spring, summer, fall, and winter, and although various areas of the United States experience drastically different weather during these times, all portions of the country recognize the seasons; winter in California may bring heat, and winter in New York may bring blizzards, but both periods are nevertheless winter.
Following winter, spring begins on 20 March and ends on either 20 June or 21 June, in the United States (this date may vary slightly from year to year and hemisphere to hemisphere). For most, spring is a time of "thawing," when the cold and snow of the winter are replaced by sunshine, reasonable temperatures, green grass, and more. It is also the season wherein previously dormant bees and butterflies reemerge, and when birds become more active.
Summer follows spring and spans from about 21 June to 22 September, in America. Summer is the warmest, the longest, and (arguably) the liveliest of the four seasons; students from kindergarten to college are given two or so summer months off from class, and to be sure, there are more young individuals out and about during this season than any other. It's not uncommon to see shorts, t-shirts, and sunglasses worn by those who're soaking up the summer's hot sun, and to stay cool, many individuals crank the air conditioning, take a dip in a swimming pool, and/or explore the ever-comforting ocean waves.
Autumn (or fall), more than being a simple precursor to winter, is one of the most beautiful and exciting seasons. Spanning from 22 September to 21 December (technically, that is; snow will begin to fall long before this latter date, in most parts of the country, leading many to classify the period as winter) in the US, autumn is characterized by falling leaves, Halloween (on 31 October), and Thanksgiving. During fall, traditional farmers harvest their produce, and the aforementioned falling leaves change to gorgeous orange, red, and yellow colors; these colors are generally associated with autumn itself, in turn.
In the US, winter spans from 21 December to 20 March, and is, as one would expect, the coldest of the four seasons. In the eastern, northern, and central portions of the country, winter snowfall can be considerable; in the western and southern portions of the country, winter snowfall is highly unlikely, but temperatures nevertheless drop from their usual. Winter is most widely known for its snow and the Christmas holiday, but it also boasts New Year's Eve (on December 31, in recognition of the start of a new year) and other special days. Ice skating, sledding, ice hockey, and snowball fights are commonly enjoyed winter activities.



The Golden Gate Bridge
Some of the most important landmarks in the United States include feats of architecture and modern engineering. San Francisco, California, is a beautiful city on its own, but it is also home to The Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7 mile suspension bridge connecting the San Francisco Peninsula to the Marin Headlands. The bridge holds the title of one of the Wonders of the Modern World according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
One of the most popular ways to appreciate the bridge is to take an excursion to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area just outside of San Francisco. The park contains hiking trails, great spots for picnicking, and offers some of the best vantage points for panoramic photographs of the bridge leading into the city.
David recently had some friends visit him in San Francisco, and he made sure to include a visit to the recreation area as part of their tour. They enjoyed walking through the trails, observing some of the native wildlife, and even having a casual picnic in the park. David’s friends were thankful that he guided them through this impressive area of California. They made sure to take a group photograph with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. David’s friends had the picture framed, and they later presented it to David in order to thank him for his hospitality during their stay.



The Grand Canyon
The Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, is located in the state of Arizona. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles in length, up to 18 miles in width, and it measures over a mile in depth at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon, and recently he received the chance to hike some of the trails and take several panoramic photographs during his visit.
When Carlos arrived at the visitor center, he watched a brief movie that taught tourists about the Grand Canyon National Park and the geological history of the canyon’s formation. Later, Carlos followed a hiking trail to become even further acquainted with the canyon. While walking through the trails, Carlos saw some tourists riding donkeys to traverse the canyon’s ridges. Throughout his hiking expedition, Carlos used a map to find some of the best hot spots for photographs within the canyon. He revisited some areas at different points in the day because sun angles and lighting can make a big difference in the quality of a photo.
Carlos was very pleased that he got to travel to the Grand Canyon. He loves hiking and photography, so this was the perfect outdoor experience for him. He posted all of his best pictures on social media, and his friends were amazed by his breathtaking, panoramic shots.





The most expensive Taco
The most expensive Taco in the world costs more than $25,000. You can buy it at a resort in Mexico. Chefs have special beef from Japan flown in for this food.
They also use a special ingredient called caviar. Fish eggs are used to make caviar. The fish eggs come from a special white fish.
The taco also has a unique cheese made with wild mushrooms and milk. This very expensive taco even has gold in its salsa. The chefs also use the best peppers, alcohol and coffee from Asia to make the salsa.
Chefs sprinkle more gold on the top. Then, they serve it to hungry guests. Diners say this taco is delicious. Many, however, say it is not worth the price. They say that there needs to be more than one taco to make them full. They are glad the restaurant offers more choices.
The cost of the taco does not include a stay at the resort. Guests spending the night must pay $990 to spend a night at the resort



The Statue of Liberty
The Statue of Liberty, arguably one of New York City’s most iconic symbols, is a popular tourist attraction for first-time visitors to the city. This 150-foot monument was gifted to the United States from France in order to celebrate 100 years of America’s independence. The statue is located on Liberty Island, and it is accessible by taking a ferry from either Battery Park in New York City or Liberty State Park in Jersey City.
When Claire visited the Statue of Liberty for the first time, she instantly admired it as a symbol of freedom. Claire made sure to make reservations before her visit because only 240 people are permitted to climb the staircase to the top of the statue every day. After climbing almost 400 stairs, Claire received spectacular views of the city from the statue’s crown.
During her visit, Claire learned that the Statue of Liberty was not always the color that it is now. She found out that because the statue’s exterior is made of copper, the statue oxidized over time, giving it the greenish appearance it has in present day. When it was first constructed, the statue was the same color as a shiny penny!
After touring the Statue of Liberty, Claire spent the rest of the day in New York City visiting other important monuments and historic landmarks. Claire left New York hoping to have had the time to explore more sites, but she can’t wait to return to the city in the future.



Valentine's Day
Valentine's Day (or Saint Valentine's Day) is a holiday that, in the United States, takes place on February 14, and technically signifies the accomplishments of St. Valentine, a third-century Roman saint.
With that said, most Americans, instead of honoring St. Valentine through religious ceremony, enjoy the holiday by engaging in "romantic" behavior with their significant other or someone who they wish to be their significant other; gifts, special dinners, and other acknowledgements of affection comprise most individuals' Valentine's Day celebrations.
Chocolates and flowers are commonly given as gifts during Valentine's Day, as are accompanying greeting cards (greeting card companies release new Valentine's Day designs annually). Red and pink are generally understood to be "the colors" of Valentine's Day, and many individuals, instead of celebrating romantically, spend the holiday with their friends and/or family members.
Variations of Valentine's Day are celebrated across the globe throughout the year. In America, the holiday, although acknowledged by the vast majority of the population, isn't federally recognized; no time off work is granted for Valentine's Day.





Washington, D.C
Yesterday, Stephen returned from a trip to Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. His visit took place during the week prior to the Fourth of July. Logically, there were many activities and celebrations in town in preparation for Independence Day. During his stay in the city, Stephen visited a lot of important historical sites and monuments, and he left with a deeper understanding of the political history of the United States.
Stephen spent a lot of time outdoors exploring the important monuments surrounding Capitol Hill. Of course, he saw the White House from its outside gate at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Stephen also visited the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial. These statues and pavilions are dedicated to former U.S. presidents. They commemorate the contributions that these leaders made throughout American history. Washington, D.C. also has several war memorials dedicated to fallen soldiers during the major wars of the 20th century.
Away from the Capitol Hill area, Washington, D.C. has many museums and art galleries worth visiting. Stephen enjoyed his visit to Washington, D.C. because he learned a lot more about American history after touring each important landmark.



Yellowstone National Park
Yellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was established as the first national park in the United States. The park is a popular destination for visitors who enjoy ecological tourism as it offers forests, mountains, and abundant ecosystems to explore. Some of Yellowstone’s most well-known landmarks are its geothermal hot springs and geysers, the most famous of which is named Old Faithful.
Last fall, Lisa and her friends decided to take a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. They arranged to stay at one of the park’s many convenient campsites. For their camping trip, they brought their backpacks, sleeping bags, and a cooler of food and drinks. They pitched their tents immediately upon arriving to their campsite.
During their trip, Lisa and her friends hiked the many trails of the park, exploring its natural surroundings. In the forest, they saw a lot of local wildlife. Lisa was surprised to see a family of grizzly bears, some gray wolves, and even bald eagles flying overhead. Outside of the woods, they admired the beauty of some of Yellowstone’s natural cascades.
Since Yellowstone contains many hot springs and the world’s largest area of active geysers, Lisa and her friends visited many different geyser sites. They even spent an afternoon swimming in Yellowstone’s Boiling River. Of all of the sites, Lisa and her friends agreed that Old Faithful was the most impressive. Lisa and her friends waited patiently for the geyser to erupt. After about 40 minutes, a stream of boiling water over 100 feet tall sprayed from the ground and up into the air. Fortunately, no one got wet!

An Olympic Blog
The Opening Ceremony
This set the scene for the Games with an amazing show featuring music, dancing, historical figures, fireworks and British humour. A huge number of volunteers practised for months to make everything perfect. The best moment was when the old lady in Buckingham Palace turned round and showed that she was neither a lookalike nor an actor but Her Majesty the Queen. The next best bit was when she jumped out of a helicopter with James Bond (although I think that actually was an actor!).
Team GB
I was very proud of our team as we kept on winning medals and finished in third position in the medal table, which is truly a great result for Great Britain. There were so many incredible sportsmen and women. The ones that stand out for me are Mo Farah, the Somalian-born Londoner who won the 10,000 and 5,000 metres with the whole stadium going crazy, Jessica Ennis, the popular super-athlete from Sheffield who won the heptathlon, and Nicola Adams who won the first female boxing medal in Olympic history for Britain.
The Olympic Stadium crowd
Although the crowd cheered on the British, there was lots of support for athletes of other nationalities too like the wonderful Usain Bolt, from Jamaica, who won the 100 and 200 metres sprint to become the fastest man alive. There was also Oscar Pistorius of South Africa who was the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics. He went on to win two gold medals and a silver in the Paralympics.
New sports
I have really enjoyed being able to watch sports which are not normally shown on television. Before the Olympics I didn’t expect to love watching judo or find myself screaming at the television during a game of wheelchair tennis, but I really got into them. I didn’t know anything about goalball before the Paralympics but it became one of my favourite sports.
The organisation and the atmosphere
It took seven years of planning and 70,000 volunteers to make everything go well. Many people have said that the organisation was not as perfect as that of the Beijing Games, but there was a much better atmosphere which spread out through the whole city. The volunteers were always friendly and helpful and Londoners even began talking to each other, and visitors, on the underground trains!

Your Local Caff
Remember when cafés served full English breakfasts – sausages, beans, fried bread, bacon and eggs – with a strong cup of tea? Well, this place still does and you can have your breakfast at any time you like during the day while you listen to your favourite tunes from the 1980s. 
The Lemon Tree
This pretty restaurant serves healthy food that’s tasty too. Come in for a vegetarian snack at lunchtime or a great fruit smoothie or a cappuccino and a delicious piece of cake in the afternoon. Food is bought from local producers whenever possible.
Cheesy Bites
A restaurant that only serves cheese, but hundreds of cheeses from many countries and in lots of different forms. They serve reasonably priced lunches but dinner can be expensive. Lovely food and a very elegant dining room, looking onto an amazing flower garden.
Fast Best
Fast food doesn’t have to be junk food, as this café proves. Do you fancy a really good hamburger made with the best ingredients, or old-fashioned fish and chips fried to perfection, all on the table in super-quick time? Speed and quality are important here, and the prices aren’t bad either.
The Chocolate Box
The owner of this small café used to cook all kinds of food, but then she realised she preferred desserts to anything else. If you want meat or fish, don’t come here. They only do desserts! Lots of different kinds of sweets. Chocolate lovers will be excited by the range of chocolate cakes.
Musical Chairs
Have you noticed how music improves the taste of your food? This new restaurant has different types of live music every night except Sundays, and excellent food to go with it. Great fish dishes, steak and pizza. Monday is classic rock night, so see you there!



Interview with Henry Smiles
He’s the most popular member of one of the most popular bands in the world. We met Two Direction’s Henry Smiles to find out why he has so many female fans.
Let’s get the basic questions out of the way first, Henry. How old are you and where are you from?
I was born in 1996 and I’m from Harrogate in the north of England. Now I live in London.
What are your likes and dislikes?
Well, I love music, of course, and sleeping and eating. And my dislikes? I don’t like it when I’m late for things.
What are your favourite films?
Spider-Man 2 and X-Men were pretty cool.
Is there anything that you’d like to be able to do?
I wish I could play the drums and the piano.
You are famous for your great hair. Would you cut it or shave it off?
Maybe I’d shave it off for charity, if I could raise a lot of money for doing it.
Do you like social networking?
Well, I don’t go on Facebook very much, but I do use Twitter a lot. It’s a good way to keep in touch with our fans.
Now the more interesting questions! Have you got a girlfriend, Henry?
No, not at the moment. I’m single!
What kind of girls do you like?
I like girls with a good sense of humour, who don’t take life too seriously. I also like being able to call someone in the middle of the night for a chat if I need to.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
Oh, I like both! If we can have a laugh and we get on well, I don't care what colour hair they have.
Are you romantic when you’re in a relationship?
I reckon I am. I’d do anything for love!
Who did you have your first kiss with?
My first kiss? Hmm, I can’t remember very clearly, but I think it was with a girl at school when I was about thirteen.
Tell us a secret, Henry.
I still get really nervous before a concert and have to drink herbal tea! Even today, after having done hundreds of concerts, my hands sweat and my heart beats really fast just before going on stage.



Skills for the 21-st century workplace
Have you got the skills you need for the 21st-century workplace?
We need to develop all kinds of skills to survive in the 21st century. Some, like ICT skills and knowledge of the digital world, are taught explicitly in schools in the UK. Here are five less obvious ones for you to think about. These are the sorts of skills that employers may ask you questions about in interviews, so it’s a good idea to think about how good you are in these areas. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Imagination
In the age of technology that we are living in now, it is no longer enough to keep on making the same products. Employers need people who can imagine new approaches and new ideas.
Think: Think of an object or gadget you use every day. How could it be improved? Can you think of three improvements?
Problem solving
Employers will value workers who are able to see problems before they happen and come up with creative solutions.
Think: Imagine you are organising an end-of-term social event at school. Think of some problems that you could face. Can you think of any solutions?
Communication skills
Workers will have to be good communicators. They will have to be able to negotiate and discuss key issues and also write in a clear way without using too many words.
Think: How do people communicate with each other in the 21st century?
Critical analysis
Employers want workers who are able to recognise the difference between information that can be believed and false information.
Think: Use the internet to find out three facts about a celebrity or famous figure. Can you verify the information by checking other websites?
Decision making
Individual workers have a growing amount of responsibility. It is important to be able to evaluate a situation and be confident in making a decision.
Think: Which three things could you do to (a) be healthier (b) do better at school and (c) help others? Make a decision now to do at least one of these things. Then … just do it!



Colors
Different Colours can affect us in many different ways; that’s according to Verity Allen.  In her new series ‘Colour me Healthy’, Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make.  They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are. 
‘Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?’ says Verity.  ‘Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red.  It’s never green.  Why not?  For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit disgusting.  It’s the same for businesses.  We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don’t respect one that uses pink or orange.  People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.’
During this four-part series, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each programme.  She meets people who work in all aspects of the colour industry, from people who design food packets, to people who name the colours of lipsticks.  Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to support their ideas, such as the American ‘Colour Doctor’ who believes that serious diseases can be cured by the use of coloured lights.  However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results. 
Overall, it’s an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new.  But because Verity is goes out of her way to be polite to everyone she meets on the series, it’s up to the viewers to make their own decisions about how much they should believe.



Fourteen-year-old Neil Atkins talks about working on a house-building project in the United States.
I got involved in the house-building project through my Uncle Brian. We went to stay with him in the United States for six weeks during the summer holiday. He was helping out on the project and asked me to come along. At first I wasn’t interested. I was enjoying watching lots of new channels on TV! But after a while I got bored and went along to see what he was doing.  I realised that what he was doing was really great!
He was helping out for an organisation that builds houses for people who can’t usually afford them. Instead, the organisation buys all the wood and bricks and things you need to build a house. It lends the family the tools and hires some guys who know what they’re doing. They also get people like my uncle, who aren’t builders but who just want to help out in the community, to do the more simple building jobs. The family eventually pay all the money back to the organisation, but they can do this over many years, and it’s much cheaper than buying a new house.
I helped out with moving dirt and preparing tea. It was a bit disappointing that I wasn’t allowed to use the tools and do jobs like cutting wood and nailing things together. I understand why they do it, but do design and technology at school so I know I could do it right. Some people had no idea how to use a hammer correctly!  But if I go back next year, I’ll be able to do it, because I’ll be fifteen then.





Horton
At first glance, there is little in Horton to attract people. The other nearby towns have much more to offer: Bradfield has its river and historic buildings, while Newtown has shops and entertainment. The buildings of Horton look dirty and unloved. For shops, there is a small supermarket, a few bargain shops, a bakery which, strangely, does not sell bread and a florist which has one stand of sad-looking flowers. Even so, Horton has several advantages over its neighbouring towns.
Firstly, it has a country park. Four thousand years ago, this was an important fort. There are no historic remains here now, but there are wonderful views over the countryside. On sunny weekends you can often see kids out with their parents, kicking balls or flying kites.
There aren’t many job opportunities in Horton, and the roads to nearby cities aren’t really fast, but there are excellent rail links. You can be in London in an hour and a half, and other cities are less than an hour away. That means that parents can earn a good salary and still get home in time to spend the evenings with their families. Houses in Horton aren’t pretty, but they’re functional and cheap. The streets are quiet and safe, and there are plenty of parks and playgrounds. It has a library, three primary schools and a secondary school, St. Mark’s.  It’s not as academically brilliant as other schools in the area, but it is friendly and offers a wide range of subjects and activities to children of all abilities and backgrounds.  The town also has a swimming and a sports centre, and the community halls hold regular clubs and events for people of all ages.



Some English Villages
Explore the Villages around Hartbridge
Many visitors come to Hartbridge to see the wonderful art galleries and museums, the beautiful buildings and the fantastic parks. Few people go outside the city, and so they miss out on experiencing the scenery and the fascinating history of this beautiful area. This brochure will tell you what you can see if you take a short bus ride out of the city.
Camberwell
The historic village of Camberwell was once the home of the wealthy Hugo family. They lived in a huge country house, Camberwell Court, and owned all the land in the area. The family sold their house in the 1940s, and it is now open to the public. You can spend a whole day walking around the house and gardens. There is a small exhibition about the family, a children’s play area, a gift shop and a restaurant. But the village of Camberwell is also worth a visit. There are some beautiful cottages with well kept gardens, and there is a small church which dates back to the eleventh century. To get to Camberwell, take Bus 46 from the Bus station. Buses leave every two hours.
Hidcot
Hidcot is an attractive village situated on the River Owell. Wildlife lovers should visit the Nature Park to the south of the village, where there are large numbers of rare birds and flowers. However, you will probably see plenty of wildlife from the bridge in the village centre! In Hidcot, you can take a two-hour river cruise - a great way to see the countryside and learn about the local wildlife from a guide. If you prefer to explore the river by yourself, it’s well worth walking one and a half miles along the river to the pub ‘The Boat’ which cannot be reached by road. Here, you can hire small boats and explore the river at your leisure. To get to Hidcot, take Bus 7A to Reeford. Hidcot is half way between Hartbridge and Reeford.
Tatterbridge
The beautiful village of Tatterbridge was home to the children’s writer Jane Potter, whose stories of Benjamin Bear are loved by adults and children around the world. Jane Potter’s home is now a museum and tea shop, and is well worth a visit just for its wonderful gardens. It also has a gift shop where you can buy souvenirs and books. Tatterbridge has a number of interesting shops including an excellent cake shop, and ‘Wendy’s Giftshop’ where you can find lots of unusual gifts made by hand by local artists. Lovers of Jane Potter’s books should also walk to the Green Valley woods, which have not changed since Jane Potter wrote her stories there one hundred years ago.
To get to Tatterbridge, take Bus 4 from outside the cinema. It takes about 40 minutes to get there.
Moordale
This old industrial village is the highest village in the area. Here in the hills, coal was found in the late eighteenth century, and people came here in great numbers to take it out of the ground and transport it to the nearby towns. Many industries grew up in the area, including a paper factory and a cotton factory. The industries all closed down in the nineteenth century, and since then Moordale has gone back to being a quiet farming village. However, if you walk from the village centre up the steep hill to the north, you can still see the paths where horses used to carry the coal. There is a four mile walk around the village which has some amazing views, but walkers are must be careful as the path is steep in places and they could slip. To get to Moordale, take Bus 7A to Reeford, and then take the number 38 bus to Moordale.

6: Drayton Manner
One of the UK's most popular attractions. The park is home to some of the scariest rides you'll find like Stormforce 10 and Apocalypse, which has been voted the UK's most frightening ride.

8: Black Country Museum

The end of TV?
I keep reading articles that argue the TV is dead. According to this view, people are spending far more time using the Internet for their entertainment and for information. As a result, they argue the TV is becoming less and less important in our lives. The time we spend watching videos online is certainly increasing but I don't think this is a reason to believe we should be saying goodbye to the television.
The TV is still a very popular way a lot of us get our entertainment at home. It offers us the chance to see top musical artists, great films and documentaries and sometimes, thanks to important live events, it has the power to bring the whole country and all ages together in a way the Internet never could. How often do thousands or even millions of friends or families sit down at the same time to watch something together online?
Some people argue that the TV offers a poor quality of programmes on the many channels we now have. It is certainly true that many of the channels do nothing more than repeat old shows or offer cheap, low quality programmes. However, I would argue that a lot of content on the Internet isn't particularly great. At least TV shows have professional people checking the quality of shows, which a lot of content on the web doesn't.
I agree that it is easy to keep up-to-date with the latest news on the Internet, even though much of it is not true or certainly can't be trusted. I enjoy sitting down to the news on TV in the evening, knowing that I am more likely to believe the information than the things I read online. Anybody can post information on the Internet and a lot of it is opinion rather than fact.
So I don't think we should be so quick to say goodbye to the TV. In fact, I think it has many more years left in it! I certainly won't be swapping my TV for the latest laptop and will continue to enjoy relaxing in front of it in the evenings.




Jacques Costeau: A remarkable man
Jacques-Yves Cousteau was an explorer, ecologist, filmmaker, inventor and conservationist. He was a man, who spent nearly his whole life underwater exploring the hidden depths of the ocean and who did more to educate the world about the mysteries of the deep sea than any other scientist before or since. He was born in June, 1910 in the village of Saint-André-de-Cubzac, in south western France. Jacques was a sickly boy and spent much of his time in bed, reading books and dreaming about a life at sea. In 1220, Jacques' family moved to New York and he was encouraged to start swimming to build up his strength. This was the beginning of his fascination with water and the more he learnt through his own experiences, the more passionate he became about "looking through nature's keyhole". Nevertheless, his career in underwater exploration came about by accident. After entering France's naval academy and travelling around the world, he was involved in an almost fatal car accident that left him seriously injured with two broken arms. He began swimming in the Mediterranean Sea to strengthen his arm muscles as part of his recovery process and rediscovered his love of the ocean. Cousteau developed a pair of underwater breathing apparatus to allow him to stay underwater for long periods of time. His experiments led to the development of the first Aqua-Lung which was a great commercial success. During World War II, he worked for the French Resistance and experimented with underwater photographic equipment. He helped to get rid of German mines and was awarded the Legion D'Honneur and the Croix de Guerre medals for his bravery. In 1942, he filmed his first underwater film Sixty Feet Down. It was 18 minutes long and was entered in the Cannes Film Festival.



Nothing Hill Carnival
Notting Hill Carnival takes place in London every August bank holiday, and is the most colourful and largest street event in the UK. The festival celebrates the traditions of the Afro-Caribbean community, who emigrated to England from the West Indies in the 1950s. They brought with them the Caribbean idea of the carnival, with colourful costumes, processions, steel bands and street dancing. Preparations for the carnival start many months in advance. Costumes need to be made, and floats built, ready for the carnival street procession. Steel bands practise traditional Caribbean music on instruments built from used oil barrels. Just before the festival, the streets are decorated with yellow, green and red streamers, and amplifying devices are set in place, to carry the rhythmic sounds over the roar of the London traffic. The carnival is celebrated over three days, and is full of music and colour. Processions of steel and brass bands, floats, and dancers in colourful costumes make their way through the narrow London streets, watched by tens of thousands of people. The streets are lined with stalls selling tropical fruits, such as fresh mangoes, watermelons and pineapple. Everyone dances - young and old, black and white - and even the policemen on duty take part in the fun. For these three days in August, a little Caribbean magic touches the streets of London.

O' Connell Street
O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare and is one of the busiest shopping streets in Dublin. Even though it is not a very long street, the locals will proudly tell the visitor that it is the widest street in all of Europe. This claim often meets with protests, especially from French people, claiming the Champs Elysees of Paris as Europe's widest street. But the witty Irishman won't easily relinquish bragging rights and will trump the French visitor with a fine distinction: The Champs Elysees is an avenue; O'Connell is a street. Divided by a few important monuments running the length of its centre, the street is named after Daniel O'Connell, an Irish patriot. His monument stands at the lower end of the road, facing O'Connell Bridge. O'Connell stands high above the business people, unhurried crowds of shoppers and students on a big column, surrounded by four angels representing Patriotism, Courage, Eloquence and Fidelity. Further up the street on the other side is the famous General Post Office or the GPO as Dubliners call it. During the Easter Rising of 1916, the GPO was taken over by the Irish Volunteers on Easter Monday and occupied by the revolutionary forces, sparking weeks of armed combat in the heart of Dublin. To this day, three of the angels bear bullet holes - two with a wound in the chest and one in its left arm.

Dublin
OUTDOOR DUBLIN
With attractive public gardens, elegantly designed squares and the sprawling expanse of Phoenix Park, Dublin provides a wealth of green space, with plenty of opportunities for a stroll or an alfresco picnic. Outside the city, the shores of Dublin Bay offer bracing walks, while hardier souls might fancy a dip in the sea.
CHILDREN'S DUBLIN
There's plenty in Dublin for kids to enjoy. As well as the attractions shown here, there's fun to be had exploring the delights of the National Wax Museum and Tara's Palace or venturing into the great outdoors, with trips to Phoenix Park or the seaside. Most attractions and activities offer signiﬁcant discounts to children.
SHOPPERS' DUBLIN
Dublin boasts some excellent book and CD shops, the most notable of them specializing in Irish literature and music. Fashionistas are well catered for too, with plenty of boutiques, jewellery shops and department stores stocking the best of Irish and global design. On a ﬁne day, consider heading for a food market or an artisan deli and picnicking in one of the city's attractive squares.
SPORTING DUBLIN
Sport is an integral part of Irish life and no more so than in the capital. Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby matches feature on pub TV screens and as a prominent part of daily conversation, and newspaper coverage seems boundless. Then there's also that well-known Irish fondness for a ﬂutter, be it on the horses or the dogs.
FESTIVALS
Dublin stages numerous festivals during the year. The arts are particularly well catered for, with major events devoted to theatre, ﬁlm, music and literature an established part of the calendar. There's plenty for children to enjoy as well, such as the St Patrick's festival and numerous events in Temple Bar.
FREE DUBLIN
Though Dublin is an expensive city, there are plenty of free attractions that won't burden your pocket or purse. Some major sites, such as the National Gallery and National Museum, charge no entrance fee except for special events. There's also plenty of street and outdoor entertainment, especially in summer.
DUBLIN TASTES
Dublin's culinary reputation is fast improving, though prices can sometimes be off-putting. The pleasures of modern Irish cuisine (as well as the ﬁner points of Guinness) are dealt with elsewhere, but there are plenty of traditional tastes that won't break the budget and will leave you with an evocative memory of the city.



Being yourself
Everybody likes to feel that she or he is special. Sadly, many of us grow up believing that we're not special at all. We wish that we could be more attractive or better at sports. We wish we had more money or nicer clothes. Like the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, or the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz, we think we're not good enough just as we are. In the film, The Tin Man wishes he had a heart. The Scarecrow wishes that he had a brain, and the Lion wants courage. Eventually, each of them realizes that he already has what he wants. Nearly all parents want us to be the best we can be. They occasionally attempt to encourage us to do better by comparing us to others. They mean well, but the message we usually get is that we're not good enough. We start to believe that the only way we can be special is by being better than somebody else, but we are frequently disappointed. There will always be somebody out there that is better than we are at something. There are a lot of people around who may not be as intelligent as we are but who are better at sports. Or they may not be as handsome, but they have more money. It is unthinkable for us to be better than everybody else all the time. Like the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion, we all need what we believe will make us better people. What we don't understand is that often we already have inside us the very things that we look for. Our parents often forget to tell us that we are special, that we are good enough just as we are. Perhaps no one told them when they were growing up, or maybe they just forgot. Either way, it's up to us to remind them sometimes that each of us, in our own way, is special. What we are . . . is enough.



The Importance of Music in Schools
 "Music helps the mind develop and grow," my dad often says, and I have found this to be very true.
It is a proven fact that participating in a music program in school will help develop your brain to a higher
level and faster than other students. Music actually improves communication between the right and left
sides of the brain, allowing you to gain better comprehension and memorization skills.
So, why do we need music in our schools? Well, because music is everything.
Music is science. It is exact and demands acoustics. The conductor's score is a graph that contains
volume changes, melody and harmony, all the while keeping the group at a constant pace.
Music is math. It is based on the rhythmic subdivisions of time, done in a split second.
Music is history. The music you hear or play is usually an indication of the time and environment in
which it was created.
Music is physical education. It requires an immense amount of coordination of fingers, hands, arms,
lips, cheeks and facial muscles. Not to mention control of your diaphragm, back, stomach and chest
muscles to make sure every note comes out clearly and in pitch.
Music is a foreign language. Its terms are usually in Italian and the music is not in any language known
to man. It is its own language and uses symbols to represent ideas.
Music is the universal language that everyone understands and can relate to. Music is what brings
everything together.
Most of all, music is art. It is the greatest form of art that allows a human to take boring notes on a
page, and transform them into an emotion and feeling you cannot measure.
Music is just as important as all the classes you are required to take, and it is critical that music classes
remain in schools. Not only to provide a place for students to belong, but also something that will help
their minds grow and develop like no other class.

Wildlife Filmmakers
Richard and Sonia Muller make documentaries about wildlife, particularly
dangerous animals, like the big cats found in Africa. Film-making for
them is a way to bring the message of the importance of understanding
wildlife to international audiences, with their last film, Staying
Alive, exploring relationships between lions and other wildlife in one
African region. When Richard and Sonia were invited to help with a
special project run by a wildlife organisation that was providing
information about the falling numbers of big cats, especially lions,
they immediately agreed to take part.
Richard grew up near a wildlife park and as a child was keen on filming
what he saw. The couple were introduced at university in Cape Town, and
quickly realised how much they had in common. They were both curious
about the natural world and Sonia soon discovered a similar talent for
filmmaking. As a child in South Africa Sonia often ran off alone to
explore the wild areas surrounding her home, despite her parents’ fears.
When asked what they found hardest about their work, Sonia and Richard
have the same answer - leaving an area and finishing a project. Sonia
adds that the hours required can be hard, and things like the heat,
dust, and bugs make it very tiring. The excitement of her work comes
from not knowing what will happen, perhaps even discovering something
new for science, while Richard takes most interest in spending time with
individual animals, getting to know their character.
The pair visit schools around the world, and notice that students with
access to lots of information don’t always have as much understanding about
geography as students in countries where access is limited. “Students
without the internet constantly available actually look at maps, they want
to find out where they are and often end up with a better idea of place,”
Richard says. A major part of their work is explaining to students the
importance of a fuller understanding of various environments by studying
the climate, animals and culture of a specific location.
If you’d like a similar career, Richard suggests studying various
different areas of biology, rather than learning about the latest filmmaking technology, as an understanding of the natural world will last
forever. The couple also give general advice for those wanting to help
protect the environment. Sonia explains that it’s important to allow
yourself to concentrate. “Turning off personal electronic items gets you
closer to the natural world,” she says. “You can watch nature, instead
of listening for your mobile phone.” Most importantly they agree that if
urgent action isn’t taken, more animals might be lost. However, the fact
that more teenagers are getting involved offers some hope for the
future.



My job at a summer camp
Every year I work at a summer camp for kids and I really enjoy seeing the children do things they
never thought they could do. Nearly all the kids know how to swim and play table-tennis before they
come, but things like rock climbing are new experiences for most. Some of them are very nervous,
but after a bit of encouragement, they agree to try and they all get to the top in the end, which makes
them feel great.
The kids stay several weeks and some do miss home. You might expect it to be the really young ones
who feel like that the most but it’s actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don’t let them use their
mobile phones all the time. First we tell them they can phone home after lunch. Then when they ask
again, usually after dinner, we say it’s a bit too late to phone and suggest doing it the next day. Most
children are fine in a couple of days and at the end of their stay, it’s amazing how many come and
thanks us because they have had a great time.
It’s not just the children who get lonely. We get parents who are on the phone the whole time, asking
how their child is getting on, which is quite unnecessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy,
playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell parents to ring back another time.
Some kids arrive dressed in smart, designer, new clothes and they sometimes argue when we tell
them to change into something they won’t mind getting dirty, but before long they realise what we
mean

Comedy Kids
Do you enjoy watching comedy? Do all your friends at school think
you tell great jokes? Then why not come and see whatís happening
at Comedy Kids?
Comedy Kids own comedy clubs in several countries that are run
just for young people aged 10-15. Theyíre real clubs with real
comedians, who are just as familiar with working in adult comedy
clubs as they are working with children. But donít take our word for
it ñ come and see for yourself!
The Comedy Kids company was set up by John Winterton, who says that no-one had thought of
being a stand-up comedian for young people until he came along. In fact, his act quickly became so
popular that he soon found lots of other comedians who wanted to join his company and perform for
families and young people. And if you think, as many others do, that a young peopleís comedian
leaps on stage in a brightly-coloured costume and big red nose ñ think again. John usually appears
dressed in a cool black jacket and trousers ñ more like a Hollywood movie star than a circus clown!
If youíre having a party at home Comedy Kids can come and perform for you there at your party ñ
just ask! Of course, itís not the same as performing on stage, so weíre always looking for comedians
in the clubs who are good at working with small numbers of young people ñ and weíve discovered
there arenít many of them about! But the ones we have found are brilliant. Your very own
comedian will also help you to tell your guests some jokes and silly stories ñ and they can join in
too, if they want! Itíll be fun ñ and very different from any party youíve ever had before!
Here at Comedy Kids, itís not just about the adults telling the jokes. We also have very short ëopen
spotsí where young people get the chance to perform. But weíve yet to find someone who can do
that without preparation, so weíve set up the worldís first ëComedy Classesí to teach young people
how to tell jokes on stage. At the moment our classes are only monthly, but weíre planning to start a
number of others over the coming year. So if you want to be a comedian but donít want to wait until
you grow up, this is where you can do it. And if youíre creative but feel youíre lacking in the
confidence to speak up, we can certainly help. Weíll listen to what you want to do, and try to make
it happen.
So what are you waiting for? Come and join Comedy Kids! 



Underwater research
Fourteen-year-old Miguel Diaz talks
about an exciting science project
Last month I got the chance to take part in an underwater research project in an area of
the Gulf of Mexico called the Flower Gardens. A team of professional researchers, led by
the scientist Dr. Matt Phillips, was trying to learn more about the fish and various
creatures that live in this part of the sea. The Flower Gardens are a long way from the
shore and we spent three days on a boat.
The team used a piece of underwater equipment called a Remotely Operated Vehicle
(ROV) to collect information. The ROV could measure water depth and temperature and it
also had a camera that sent live film back to the boat. The ROV was great fun. It was
controlled by a computer on the boat, and I was allowed to operate it a few times.
However, the thing I enjoyed most was diving into the water. At first, I was quite
frightened ñ mainly because I couldnít see land in any direction. But as soon as I jumped
into the water, I wasnít afraid anymore. It was amazing to see the colourful fish swimming
around and I could see all the way to the Flower Gardens, which are almost 30 metres
down.
I will never forget the Flower Gardens. The trip was like a holiday but I also learnt new
things about science and research projects. The team was very friendly and everyone was
happy to explain what they knew about the sea. It was a great opportunity and it has
made me think about my goals in life. The experience will definitely help me work harder
to become a scientist. 




Sam,
I very like the week’s holiday staying at your home
very much. I really enjoyed swimming with you in the
sea, it was fun. But my journey home was awful, I
had to stay in a plane for twenty hours. Hey! Why
don’t you come to visit my place next summer? I look
forward for it!

Jo
Jo looked at the map and decided to go left. He
realised he was alone in the desert. He couldn’t imagine
what would happen to him. A pair of poisonus snakes
were in front of him, and he decided to escape, but the
two creatures were always opposite him. Suddenly he
saw a person walking on the sand, which shouted to
Jo, who was very frightened. Jo ran as fast as he
could and he reached the man. They stopped walking
after two minutes because they saw a car, but the
snakes reached Jo, they bit him and … Jo woke up. It
was only a dream.



Joe,
In my country, there are many holidays thoughout
the year, but the traditional holiday is Tet holiday. It’s
also the most important holiday. It occurs in late
January, early in February. At that time, every family
clean and decorate their houses. It’s also an occasion
for people who live far away from their home to gather

THE ICEHOTEL
For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the
midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end
of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the
winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in
a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjärvi on the frozen
Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One
night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The
following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an
ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous.
As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders,
architects and artists from all over the world come to
Jukkasjärvi and they make the hotel for that year. As
one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight
guests, while the other parts are still being built. The
first part is completed in December and each week after
that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel
is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open
sky, using the natural materials of the winter season,
the finishing date depends on nature and therefore
there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring,
as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts.
Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than –5 °C to –8 °C, however cold it may be
outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of
guests’ stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and
a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to
allow space for thick socks.
If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much
more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the
same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in.
The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjärvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from
Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the
airport or train station to the ICEHOTE



Advice for exams
Morning, everyone. Quiet, please. Right, OK. So, today I’m going to give you some advice to help you prepare for the exams next week. So, make some notes as I’m talking, please. Everybody ready?
Now, while you’re studying, eat food that gives you energy. Don’t be tempted to eat sweets or drink cola. Sugar won’t help you study but fruit and cereals will. Apples, actually, are especially good.
Find a comfortable place with plenty of light when you study. But not ‘too’ comfortable or you’ll fall asleep!
Try and keep a positive mind. It is easier to study when you are positive and relaxed. Now, if you start feeling anxious, have a little break. Go out for a stroll around the block.
Don’t try to learn everything. There isn’t time. Just choose the ‘important’ things, the things that’ll get you the most points in an exam. And if you aren’t sure about this, ask me.
First, learn the main ideas and don’t worry too much about the details. If you have time, you can come back later and read the details.
Make notes of these key points and read them, then cover them up and try to remember all the points. Now, it might be boring, but repetition helps you to remember.
Use past exam papers to study. They will help you understand what kind of questions come up. There are plenty of past exam papers in the library. You can photocopy them and take them home.
Take regular breaks while you’re studying. A five-minute break every half hour is usually enough. Get some fresh air and stretch your arms and legs. Drink a glass of water too. It’s important to keep hydrated.
And, last but not least, good luck! I’m sure you’ll all do your best.



Amazing facts
A: Hey, I’m reading this really interesting article about the human body.
B: Yeah? Well, we know all about that from biology lessons.
A: No, we didn’t learn much at all at school! They’re discovering loads more things all the time. Really amazing things! Did you know that only about one tenth of the cells in your body are really you? The rest are bacteria.
B: What? I’m not really me?
A: No, of course you are you, but you also have millions, or trillions, of bacteria in you.
B: Eeeeuuugh!
A: No, they’re mostly really helpful. Someone did an experiment to see if animals can live without bacteria, and he found that a lot of them died or had to have a special diet. Animals need bacteria to digest food, you see. So we’re better off with bacteria.
B: Unless the bacteria are bad.
A: Unless they are bad, but they’re nearly all good. Oh yeah, and going back to cells, do you know how many cells you have in your body?
B: Quite a lot, I’d say. A good few.
A: Yeah, but how many?
B: I don’t know. I’m not mathematical.
A: 7 octillion! That’s 7 plus 27 noughts.
B: I knew it was a lot.
A: OK, that’s an amazingly huge number, almost impossible to imagine. But the really weird thing is that most of the atoms are empty space, just air or nothingness. And if you took out the empty space, you could fit your body inside a tiny cube which measures one 500th of a centimetre on either side. That’s a box measuring 0.002 of a centimetre on each side. You’d be much too small to see.
B: Mmm, I can imagine that. It sounds like something that would happen in a really bad Hollywood movie. You know, a mad scientist goes: (funny voice) ‘I’m going to extract all the air from your body’. OK, enough facts for one day.
A: Don’t go! One last thing, did you know …
B: No.
A: Did you know that you probably have mites in your eyelashes?
B: Mites in my eyelashes? What are mites exactly anyway?
A: Yeah, they’re very small creatures, like insects, only not insects. They’re about a third of a millimetre long, so you can’t really see them. These particular mites live in eyelashes and eyebrows.
B: But in mine?
A: Well, maybe not. Only about 50% of people have them, and more older people. So you might not have any. Anyway, they’re completely harmless, they just eat dead skin.
B: Yeah, right, harmless. I really would have preferred not to know that.
A: Sorry.
B: I mean, really!



Celebrations
A
It was Nicky’s idea, but we all think it’s going to be brilliant. As soon as the last exams have finished, we’re going to decorate the main hall at school with paper streamers and Chinese lanterns and things. Steve had this idea of projecting photos of everyone onto a wall, like a slide show. And we’ve got Jo’s brother, who’s a professional DJ, coming along. Then there are three different bands lined up to play. Ours is the best, because we’ve been together longest and we’ve got a great bass player, (coughs) although I say so myself, so we’re on last. It’s going to be cool.
B
Every year there’s a carnival in August in London. You’ve probably heard of it, the Notting Hill Carnival? So this year, me and my friends are going again. We went last year and we had such a fantastic time. It’s all Afro-Caribbean, with people in amazing costumes and these brilliant steel bands. We don’t go in costume, but we do dance a lot. It does get quite crowded, so you have to make sure you stick together. And you have to watch out for pick-pockets when there are so many people in the same place. But it’s really good fun; it’s like London becomes a different country. Even the police dance sometimes.
C
We’re going to hire a boat for the day and take it up the river. It’s my grandparents’ golden wedding anniversary, so the whole family is getting together. I’m really looking forward to seeing my cousins again. I haven’t seen them for ages. We’ve got this huge picnic planned, with loads of different types of sandwiches and salads and an enormous cake. My dad has borrowed an ancient gramophone player, you know, what they had before CD players, and some old records. So as we go up the river we’re going to listen to music from the time my grandparents got married – the swinging sixties!
D
Two of my best friends have their birthday in the same week, so some of us have decided to have a surprise party for both of them. One of my friends, Sandra, has a big house, and her parents say we can use it. They’re going away, luckily. It’s at the end of October, so we’re going to decorate the house with Halloween things, you know, spiders' webs and spooky things. We're going to make up an excuse to get the birthday girls to come round to the house – say we’re going to help Sandra move some stuff, or something. Then, as soon as Sandra lets them in, we’re going to turn the lights out and jump out at them! We just have to make sure nobody mentions anything on Facebook and gives away the surprise.
E
There’s a Royal Wedding in June – one of our princes is getting married – so it’s a public holiday. Lots of people are having parties in squares and parks and places, and the people in our street decided to have one too. Well, it’s a good excuse to have a party, isn’t it? We’re all going to take out tables and chairs and put them together in the middle of the road. We’re going to stop cars coming through, obviously. We’re all going to bring different dishes and share them round. There are quite a lot of different nationalities living on our street – people from India, China and different African countries – so the food should be really interesting. It’ll be good to get to know more of the neighbours too.



Difficult situations

Boy: Mum?
Mother: Yes?
Boy: You know that Economics exam I had last week?
Mother: The one you didn’t revise for?
Boy: I did revise for it. I was working on it all weekend. Don’t you remember?
Mother: Oh, yes, I remember. Apart from going out until four in the morning, you mean?
Boy: Well, I have to relax a little, even if I’m revising. Anyway, I didn’t pass it.
Mother: You failed it! But wasn’t that an important one?
Boy: Yeah, I’m really sorry.
Mother: I’m really sorry too. What does that mean?
Boy: Well, I’ll probably have to retake the whole course.
Mother: Oh, Ryan! It’s a really expensive course. I’m not sure we can afford for you to take it again. Things are difficult enough as it is.
Boy: I know, Mum. I’m sorry. I’ll talk to the teacher again and see if I can retake it.





Hard Times
Girl 1: Hi, Megan. How are you?
Girl 2: Not feeling too good, actually.
Girl 1: Oh? Why’s that?
Girl 2: Well, something terrible happened this morning … (voice trembling)
Girl 1: What? Sorry, take your time, and tell me when you’re ready.
Girl 2: Well, I was playing with Bonzo in the garden with a ball, and the ball went over the hedge into the road, and …
Girl 1: Yes?
Girl 2: And Bonzo jumped over the hedge after it and he got hit by a car.
Girl 1: Oh, no! And is he … ?
Girl 2: Yes. We took him to the vet’s immediately, but there was nothing she could do.
Girl 1: Oh, poor Bonzo. And poor you. I know how much he meant to you.
Girl 2: We’d had him since he was a tiny puppy. He was like one of the family.
Girl 1: I’m really sorry. At least he had a happy life.
Girl 2: His life was too short!
Girl 1: Well, yes, OK. I’m sorry, that was a really insensitive thing to say. I’ll come round and see you later, OK?



Difficulties
Boy: Hi, Dad.
Father: Hi, how’s it going?
Boy: Did you have a good day at work?
Father: Same as usual, really. What about you? Good day at school?
Boy: Yeah, pretty good. Except for one little thing …
Father: Why do I have a sinking feeling in my stomach?
Boy: Do you remember you lent me your phone?
Father: Yes?
Boy: Well, I was standing just outside school, texting Jack, and somebody ran past and grabbed it.
Father: You let someone steal my phone?
Boy: I didn’t let them.
Father: No, I suppose not. But did you know that that might happen? Is that a dangerous spot?
Boy: Well, I had heard of that happening, but I’d forgotten. Anyway, I didn’t think it would happen to me.
Father: No, OK. Did you see who it was?
Boy: No. It was someone in a blue tracksuit, and there are loads of people who wear those. But there’s a CCTV camera on the entrance. It might have got a shot of the thief’s face.
Father: You reported it then?
Boy: Well, not yet, but I will tomorrow.
Father: All right. Don’t forget to report it tomorrow. I’ll have a look at the insurance and see if it’s covered.



Favourite things
A (boy)
My favourite thing has to be my new tablet. It’s really light and quite small, so I take it with me everywhere. I’m always writing messages to friends and it’s big enough to do college work on it too. It takes really good photos, and I play games and listen to music on it as well, of course. I often download films onto it and watch them in bed. My mum says I’m addicted, because I’m always on it. I even read things on it at breakfast time. I’m not allowed to at dinner time, though. I have to be polite and talk to people then.“Welcome back to real life," my mum says.
B (girl)
My favourite thing? Does my cat count as a thing? She’s not really a thing, but anyway. She’s a really beautiful little cat. I’ve had her since she was four months old. You know how some cats are really independent and hardly talk to you? I know cats don’t really talk, but you know what I mean. Well, she’s not like that at all. She’s really affectionate and comes up to me as soon as I get home, purring away like mad. She makes a lot of noise for a tiny thing. She loves being stroked and comes and curls up next to me when I’m on the sofa. She’s great company.
C (boy)
My new scooter! It’s quite small, but fun, and just what I needed for getting around the city. I used to have quite a long walk to the metro, then a longish walk at the other end to get to college. But now I can just whiz there on my scooter. And there’s no problem parking, there’s always space for it. You have to be careful with the cars and lorries – they don’t always see you – and when it rains the surface of the road is terrible, it gets really slippery. But in general it’s perfect for me, and I can fit a friend on the back too – I’ve got an extra helmet for a friend. It’s great. Riding along makes me feel so free.
D (girl)
This might sound a bit old-fashioned, but my sewing machine is my favourite thing. I’m studying fashion and love making things, as well as designing them. I also love clothes myself and often buy second-hand clothes –  everyone loves the “vintage” look at the moment – and then I adapt them to my size. It’s much easier using a machine to do that than doing it by hand. I do alterations for my mum and my sister too. If I don’t make it as a designer, I suppose I can always set up my own alterations and customising business. Customising clothes, by taking things off and adding things on, is actually very creative, so I wouldn’t mind that.
E (boy)
My set of Japanese knives. That sounds a bit sinister, doesn’t it, but I’m not a murderer or anything. They’re chef’s knives and the best ones come from Japan. Cooking is my new hobby. I got into it when I started watching Masterchef on TV. Then I went to an evening class for beginners, and I haven’t looked back since. I try and have a dinner for between four and eight friends every two or three weeks. That gives me something to work towards and I always do new dishes so they can try them out and give me feedback. It’s quite an expensive hobby if you use good ingredients, but now my friends help towards the cost. They still get a good meal for a very low price.



Important things
A (Girl)
She lives next door and she’s always been really important in my life. When we were little and my mum was working she used to look after us. She’d tell us stories about her childhood. It was like listening to fairy stories, life was so different when she was a child. In her kitchen she used to keep a special dish with sweets for us, and she was always baking cakes and pies. Now she doesn’t bake so much. She’s started eating more healthily in her old age, salads and vegetables and things. It’s funny how she’s changed. She also goes to this special gym class for old people, it’s amazing. I don’t see her so often now, but she’s always the same person however much her lifestyle changes.

B (Boy)
He’s four years older than me and that seemed like a huge amount when we were children. When we were at the same school we’d never talk to each other during school hours. But now we’re older it’s a lot better, although I’ll always be the little one, and that’s annoying sometimes. He’s taken me to rock concerts that I wouldn’t have gone to otherwise and when he was at uni I went to stay with him sometimes. That was really cool. It was great to see what real student life was like when I was still at school. Now that he’s working he’s really busy, but we still hang out sometimes. We go to football matches together because we both support our home team. It’s always good to see him.

C (Girl)
We’ve known each other since we were five and we’ve always got on really well. Well, apart from that time when we fell out because we both liked the same boy. But he went off with Heather Jenkins, so we made friends again quite quickly! We both like the same kind of music and going dancing at the weekend, and when we were younger we went out on our bikes together. At school we’re good at different things. I’m good at languages and Laura’s good at maths. That’s good though – it means that we can help each other with our homework. Next year I’m probably going to study in London and she’s going to Manchester, but I’m sure our relationship won’t change.

D (Boy)
His family moved in just a few houses down from us when I was about ten, and I still remember how excited I felt when I found out there was another boy on the street. I’d been the only boy, you see. The others were all girls. We were good friends from the beginning because we were into the same things: computers and football, mostly. But we had quite a few of the same hobbies for a while. I remember making lots of models of aeroplanes one year. Another year we took up fishing. We had all the equipment and everything and we’d spend ages down by the river. I never go fishing now. His family moved away a couple of years ago. We’re still friends on Facebook but we don’t really have much contact.

E (Girl)
I can remember all the details of when we met. I was wearing a red dress and I’d just had my hair cut. I can even remember what music was playing the first time I saw him. I knew he was special from the beginning, and I was right. We’ve been together ever since. Well, it’s only been eighteen months, and some people say that isn’t very long, but it seems like ages to me. We’ve got such similar personalities and so much in common. I’m sure we’ll stay together forever.



Llamas
Zoo guide: OK, are we all together? Right, next we’re going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos.
Llamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the biggest animal – they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds.
Teenager 1: Don’t they spit at people, though?
Guide: Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don’t want to mistreat a llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you.
Group of teenagers: Uuuugggh!
Guide: But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are usually gentle and curious.
OK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They’ve got smaller faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one’s face.
Group of teenagers: Aaaah!
Guide: The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep’s wool. There’s a big demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry.
Right, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas. Vicuñas are very elegant and graceful creatures. Look at this one. She’s beautiful.
Group of teenagers: Mmmm. She’s lovely. (etc.)
Guide: Have you heard of the Incas? The ancient rulers of Latin America who lived in the Andes? Well, they wore clothes made from vicuña wool – only the royal family were allowed to wear the wool. It is even softer than alpaca wool but vicuñas can only be shorn of their wool every three years. For that reason the wool’s very expensive.
And, lastly, we have the guanacos. They are similar to the vicuñas, but larger and stronger. They are capable of surviving at over 4,000 metres in the Andes. When they are in the desert they survive by licking the water off the cacti and other desert plants. Right, any questions?
Teenager 2: I think I can hear this llama making a noise.
Guide: Ah, yes. That could be the llama humming. They don’t open their mouths, they just make this strange noise. They hum when they are stressed, or the opposite, feeling relaxed.
Teenager 1: Can llamas live in the UK?
Guide: Yes, there are quite a lot of llamas and alpaca in the UK. They adapt very well to our climate. They make good pets and sometimes they’re used for trekking. You go on a picnic and use a llama to carry your food.
Teenager 3: Cool! I want to do that!
Guide: And sometimes farmers use them as guard dogs, I mean guard llama. The adult males will protect sheep and hens from animals that might attack them, like dogs or foxes. They’re really useful animals.



My favourite film
A (girl)
I really like The Notebook; it’s a romantic classic. The story is about a poor boy, called Noah, who meets a rich girl, called Allie, and they fall in love over one summer. But of course there are problems. Allie’s parents don’t approve of Noah because he’s poor and they get separated, then a lot of time passes before they can get together again. She goes away to college and he writes to her every day, but she doesn’t get the letters. Then after quite a long time, Noah buys an old house which he promised to restore for Allie. He does it up and she sees a newspaper article about it and goes to find him again. You can probably guess the rest, but it’s a bit complicated because she is engaged to another man. Noah is played by Ryan Gosling, who’s my favourite actor, and he stops the film being too soppy – but you still cry a lot at the end. Rachel McAdams is really good too, as Allie.

B (boy)
I think my favourite film is Skyfall, the last James Bond movie. It stars Daniel Craig again and Javier Bardem is this really evil baddie. They’re both great, and so is Judi Dench as M, Bond’s boss. It’s a bit different to other Bond films. The story is more important, although there is still a lot of action. It’s really well filmed, especially in the scenes which are shot in Shanghai and Scotland, and it’s really exciting, of course. Bond is also a bit different – although he does amazing things, he seems older and that makes him more human and the story more realistic. Oh, the song by Adele is great, too. You know it won an Oscar?

C (girl)
It’s not a very recent film, but I love Pride and Prejudice – the version with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy. The story is really clever and interesting, besides being romantic. It’s all about how we tend to jump to conclusions about people and we’re often completely wrong. Elizabeth thinks Mr Darcy is stuck up and snobbish at the beginning of the film, but at the end she realises she has been completely wrong and he isn’t like that at all. She also realises he has an enormous house and that maybe helps her fall in love with him too! After I saw the film I read the book by Jane Austen and I really recommend that too. Although it was published 200 years ago, it’s still a great read and really funny in parts.

D (boy)
My favourite film has to be The Matrix. Even though it was made back in 1999, it still feels really modern. It’s about this ordinary man, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, who works with computers during the day and is a hacker at night. One day he is contacted by a woman who introduces him to a very strange man: Morpheus. Morpheus explains to Neo that what he thinks of as real is actually fiction and the world is run by evil machines who have imprisoned and tricked the human race. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as Morpheus, and Keanu Reeves is excellent, but the best thing about the film is the special effects. I can watch it again and again.

E (girl)
Let the Right One In is my favourite film. There are two versions, the first is Swedish and the second American – I prefer the original, Swedish version. It’s a modern vampire film and also a kind of love story, but it’s really unsentimental and a bit scary in places. Oskar is a young boy with a lot of problems. He is being bullied at school and wants revenge on the bullies. Then some new neighbours move in next door and he becomes friends with Eli, a beautiful but strange girl. I won’t tell you any more, because it will spoil the story, but expect a serial killer, a lot of violence and blood-drinking. If you like that kind of thing, you’ll love this.



Organising your time
Host: On ‘Star Students’ today we’re speaking to Peter, who is going to tell us about the Pomodoro Technique, a system to help manage your time. It was invented by an Italian man called Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. Now, he called it the Pomodoro Technique after a tomato-shaped timer that his mother used to use when she was cooking. Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. And this tomato has helped Peter become an A-grade student. So, Peter, welcome to the studio.
Peter: Thanks.
Host: Tell us about the Pomodoro Technique. What’s it about?
Peter: It’s about getting maximum productivity from your available time. I use it for studying, but professionals use it at work.
Host: Is it difficult to follow?
Peter: No. It’s actually very simple. It’s about breaking down your work into separate jobs and then using a timer to separate your time into periods of intensive work and short breaks.
Host: OK, well, that sounds sensible. So, how do you start?
Peter: First of all, you should think about the task you need to complete. For example, writing an essay for homework. You need to think about all the stages of the task and write a clear to-do list on a piece of paper. When you are ready to start you set the timer to 25 minutes and you start working on the first item on the list.
Host: OK … but what happens when the timer goes off?
Peter: When the timer goes off you must take a short break of between 3 to 5 minutes. One 25-minute session is one ‘pomodoro’ so when you have completed this, you deserve a short break. You should try to move about a bit during the break.
Then, set the timer for another 25 minutes and keep working. At the end of the next ‘pomodoro’ you have another short break. As you complete the items on the ‘to-do’ list you should tick them off, to give you a feeling of satisfaction that you’re getting the job done.
Host: OK … I get it. Can you use any timer? Most people have timers on their phones these days. Could you use that?
Peter: You could, but the danger is that then you can check messages on your phone or you start looking at apps. I use my dad’s kitchen timer and I make sure I switch off my phone when I’m studying. I get so much more done. In the breaks I sometimes check my phone but only if I’ve completed some of the items on my to-do list.
Host: Three to five minutes isn’t long for a break. Is that enough time?
Peter: Well, when you’ve had four or five short breaks you can take a longer break, and then you start again.
Host: And it works?
Peter: Yes, it works for me! It stops me wasting time. My work is much more effective when I use the timer. It’s like short, intense periods of work. I actually get my homework done a lot quicker now, which leaves me more free time, so for me it works really well.
Host: Oh, I think I’ll give it a try. Thanks so much for coming in, Peter.
Peter: You’re welcome. Thanks for inviting me. 



Sports centres
A
Hi, come in. I’m Maya. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Grange Park Sports Centre. I’ll just show you round the centre and explain what we offer here, and then you can ask me questions. Well, as you can see, this is quite a small centre but we offer a lot of different activities at different times of the day. If you’d just like to come through here, you can see the main rooms. These are nice and light and airy and we have a very good air-conditioning system so they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Here we have classes of yoga, tai chi, Pilates and Zumba at different levels. We also have different types of dance class: jazz dancing, Indian dancing and Latin dancing. Oh, and we’ve just started offering flamenco. All our teachers are fully qualified and experienced. We have beginners’ classes up to advanced. Some of our students have been coming since we opened, ten years ago.
So, if you could follow me through here - mind the steps here - we’ve got the sauna and massage rooms. We have very reasonable prices for massages. And over here we have the gym with exercise machines. It’s quite a small gym, but usually there’s plenty of room for people to move around without any problems. OK, that’s about it. Over there we have the changing rooms with showers. You do need to bring your own towel if you want a shower, but you don’t need to bring a mat for the yoga and Pilates classes. Oh, and I must mention the café. It’s just off the main entrance. That’s very popular with our clients; we have a great selection of teas, fresh juices, sandwiches and cakes.
Right, the prices. You can join for three months, six months or a year and that gives you the right to use the gym and go to two classes a week. If you want to go to more classes or use the sauna, there’s a small extra charge. For three months the fee is …
B
OK, let me show you the gym. My name’s Bill and I’m the main sports trainer here, but we have a team of four specialists who are always around to help you with exercise programmes and give advice about lifestyle and diet. We strongly recommend that you talk to one of us as soon as you sign up and set up your personalised training programme. So, through here we have the main gym. As you can see, it’s enormous and we have lots of brand-new machines. You can do everything here, running, cycling, rowing, weights … you name it. Although we have a lot of clients, it’s very unusual to have to wait for a machine. Over there is the area for weight-training. If you want a closer look at the machines, you can come back later. Oh, by the way, you can only come in here with trainers on. No outdoor shoes, please.
OK, through here we have the swimming pool. It’s great, isn’t it? We’re very proud of it. You can use it most of the time without booking, but there are certain times of day when we have swimming classes and water aerobics. There is always a lifeguard in attendance who will also offer informal swimming tips. OK, just over there you have the changing rooms and lockers, and on the right are the bathrooms and showers. We have our own shop, here, where you can buy our own brand of sportswear and sports drinks and supplements. Right, I can see you’re impressed, and as I said, we’re very proud of our centre. However, I should warn you that we are slightly more expensive than other gyms in the area – but then we offer a much higher level of services and a very wide range of activities. Here’s a brochure with the timetables of the extra classes that we offer, such as boxing, taekwondo and capoeira and quite a few others, besides swimming activities: swimming classes, diving classes, water aerobics and water polo. OK, so have a look at the brochure, then you can speak to one of the secretaries in reception about the best combination of activities for you.



The weekend
Girl: So, have you got any plans for the weekend?
Boy: Yeah, me and my mates are going to this activity centre in the mountains.
Girl: Oh, yeah?
Boy: You can do all kinds of things. It’s a new centre; it sounds great. We’re going to go dirtboarding …
Girl: What’s that?
Boy: It’s like skateboarding or snowboarding. You have a board, or deck, to stand on and wheels. They’re pretty strong because you go down rough mountain tracks on them. Steep, rough mountain tracks.
Girl: Sounds a bit risky. Have you done it before?
Boy: No, but I’ve done similar things. Anyway, we’re also going to go canyoning. Before you ask, that’s when you jump and swim down a river canyon. You have to use ropes and special equipment. And maybe we’ll go white water rafting too.
Girl: Phew. It sounds far too difficult to me.
Boy: They have lots of things that you could do too. Like zip-wiring, you know when you go along a wire through the trees or down a mountain.
Girl: Go down a mountain on a wire!
Boy: It’s really easy, and exciting too. You just have to hold on and enjoy the ride. Or there’s bungee jumping.
Girl: Jump off a bridge on a long elastic band! Me? You’ve got to be joking! Anyway, I’m going away this weekend too, thank you for asking.
Boy: I was going to ask. So where are you going?
Girl: Paris! I’m so excited!
Boy: Paris, wow!
Girl: Yeah, it’ll be brilliant! We’re going to do all the sights, like go up the Eiffel Tower and take a boat along the River Seine and see the old parts of the city. It looks so beautiful in the photos. And then there are all the art galleries. You know how much I like art. I can’t wait to go round the Louvre and see all those famous paintings.
Boy: I think the famous Impressionist paintings are somewhere else.
Girl: Yeah, I know, they’re in the Musée d’Orsay. We’re going there too. And then I want to go to the Rodin Museum and see that famous statue, you know, The Thinker. And of course, if we’re in Paris, we’ll have to go shopping. Or look at the shops, at least. And then there’s the restaurants. Just think, French food!
Boy: You’ve got a lot planned for one weekend.
Girl: Oh, we’re going for four days, actually.
Boy: Oh, four days, very nice. And who are you going with?
Girl: Oh, just a friend.



Theme parks
Interviewer: Good morning. Today we’re going to talk about theme parks and we’re going to hear from Andy Wells who has written a guide to theme parks around the world. Welcome to the programme, Andy.
Andy: Hi, it’s good to be here.
Interviewer: You really have a dream job, don’t you, Andy? Flying round the world all the time, visiting adventure parks ...
Andy: Well, yes, it’s pretty exciting. But it’s really hard work too, you know.
Interviewer: I bet. So, what’s the number one theme park in the world?
Andy: That all depends what you’re looking for. In terms of numbers, it has to be Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, the most famous theme park. But the most popular park for people who like adventure rides is Cedar Point in Ohio, USA. It has the biggest number of rollercoasters in one park, 17, and three water rides. There are lots of other attractions too. Last year they introduced 50 animatronic dinosaurs. You know, life-size models that move and look real.
Interviewer: Cool! Have they got anything lined up for this year?
Andy: Yeah, there’s a new rollercoaster called the Gatekeeper. Well, actually it’s not a rollercoaster, it’s a wingcoaster. It’ll be the biggest in the world.
Interviewer: What’s a wingcoaster?
Andy: With a normal rollercoaster you are sitting on a seat with the track under you. With a wingcoaster the seats kind of stick out at the side so the passengers have nothing below or above them. You feel as if you’re flying.
Interviewer: So it’s more frightening?
Andy: More exciting! Way more exciting.
Interviewer: What other attractions have you seen recently?
Andy: I’ve just been to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida. It’s great! You know those shops that sell magic sweets and things in the Harry Potter books? Well, they have those, just like you’ve imagined. There’s a fantastic tour of Hogwarts School where you meet characters from the books. It’s so well done.
Interviewer: Right, sounds interesting. In your book you have a lot of theme parks in Asia too. Can you tell us about them?
Andy: Sure. Tokyo has had a Disneyland for quite a long time, which attracts a lot of people. Ocean Park in Hong Kong has also been going for a long time – that has a lot of marine animals as well as rides. Lotte World, a huge park in South Korea, has the world’s biggest indoor theme park. And then there’s Universal Studios in Singapore. That’s expanding with additions to its New York street section. There’s going to be a Sesame Street dark ride. A dark ride’s a ride inside a building.
Interviewer: I see. New York in Singapore?
Andy: Yeah, it’s weird, but it works. But the place to watch at the moment is China – they’re really expanding. Lots more parks will open in China in the next few years, including another one with dinosaurs in the north, and Ocean Kingdom in the south. That will have the world’s longest roller coaster and tallest Ferris wheel, as well as boat rides and a night-time zoo.
Interviewer: Wow, so that’s opening soon?
Andy: Yes, this year. I’ll be there!
Interviewer: Have a ride for me, then.



A phone call from a customer
Junko: Hello, Junko Mori speaking. How can I help you?
Andrea: Hi, Junko, it's Andrea here from Red Band. I'm calling about our latest order.
Junko: Everything arrived OK, right? We got the delivery confirmation at our end.
Andrea: Yes, everything's fine with the order. I'm calling about the invoice and the payment terms. I need a favour.
Junko: A favour? What do you need?
Andrea: This is a little, er ... difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms. I know they're usually 30 days, but we're having some cash flow problems. You'd really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days.
Junko: I'm not sure if I can do that, Andrea. We've got regulations at our end, and also have to manage our own cash flow.
Andrea: I promise this won't become the norm, Junko. Actually, I also want to place another new order. The same size order as last time. It's for an important customer and they pay on delivery.
Junko: I see. So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered.
Andrea: Exactly.
Junko: That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea. Let me see what I can do. Yes, I think we can make an exception this time.
Andrea: That's great, Junko. I appreciate your help.
Junko: And we appreciate your business, Andrea. It works both ways.
Andrea: Thanks again, Junko. Can you send me a quick email confirmation of the payment terms extension?
Junko: Sure, no problem. We're happy to help you.
Andrea: Great. And I'll email you the new order.
Junko: Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for it. Talk to you soon.
Andrea: You too. Goodbye.



A student discussion
Teacher: So you've got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.
Student 1: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can both support human life.
Student 2: Yeah, but do we know that's actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth, isn't it? It says here it's about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places like Antarctica get that cold.
Student 1: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from the Sun?
Student 2: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it's about 228 million kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.
Student 1: Yes, but in space that's not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres. That's why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1 astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn't sound so big when you look at it that way.
Student 2: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you're right. What other similarities are there between the two planets?
Student 1: Let's see … not the colour, obviously!
Student 2: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty obvious reasons!
Student 1: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.
Student 2: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length. Earth's day is 24 hours but Mars's is about half an hour longer.
Student 1: You're right. OK, any other things they both share?
Student 2: I suppose you could say they have water in common.
Student 1: Could you? How?
Student 2: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past. It's just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.
Student 1: Ah, I see. I don't think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth's air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?
Student 2: Mars doesn't really have air, not compared with Earth. It's got about one per cent as much air as Earth.
Student 1: Right, and it's mostly carbon dioxide.
Student 2: Gravity is another difference. I didn't know this, but Mars has higher gravity than the Moon. But it's much less than on Earth, of course.
Student 1: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth's gravity.
Teacher: OK, let's see what you've found …



A team meeting about diversity
Nina: As you know, our team has grown a lot in the past year and we feel we need to address the diversity in the team.
Brenda: How do you mean, 'address the diversity'?
Nina: Well, we all know that diversity in teams is a good thing, but it can also be a challenge for some people to respect and value people's differences. We've got a really diverse team here – people of different nationalities, backgrounds, religions, ages … and sometimes I don't feel we make the most of this.
Stefano: Yes, and even if it isn't specifically challenging, many people are simply unaware of the isolation that some team members may feel because they are different.
Brenda: So, what does this mean? What are we going to do?
Nina: Well, we need to create a workplace charter. You know, one that promotes equality, diversity and inclusion.
Brenda: That sounds like a good idea. But will people just see it as something the management team has created? Maybe they won't even pay attention to it.
Nina: I know. That's why we're going to involve everyone in creating it.
Stefano: That's a good idea. We could run some workshops and get ideas from the employees about how we can create a more inclusive workplace.
Nina: Exactly. I was thinking that before that we could run some team-building sessions so they can experience the value of diversity for themselves.
Brenda: Yes, I like that. Many people see diversity as something negative, often because there are different opinions or ways of doing things.
Nina: Yes, I know, but if there's no diversity, then the risk is that we all work in the same way, think the same and see the world the same. This makes it hard to be creative and to innovate.
Stefano: I completely agree, Nina. OK. So, what do you want us to do?
Nina: Stefano, can you look for a successful trainer who specialises in running workshops and team-building sessions on diversity and inclusion?
Stefano: Sure. I'll be happy to.
Nina: And Brenda, can you find a fun venue? Somewhere that is quite diverse itself. Something that's not the usual seminar-style environment?
Brenda: Sure. That'll be fun.
Nina: And I'm going to do some further research into how other organisations are benefiting from their diversity. I can share this with the whole team.



A weather forecast
Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week, as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared – just a few patches of cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday.
It's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather, and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy – and even thundery in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight.
Elsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England, tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees. 
By the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain. The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until tomorrow. Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can!



An interview about listening skills
Presenter: So, today's expert teacher is Gabriella, a university English teacher from Leeds. Gabriella, hi and thanks for joining us today.
Gabriella: Thanks for having me!
Presenter: So, I have to confess today's topic is something I am really bad at: listening. Most people say speaking is the most stressful part of learning a new language but, for me, with my B1 German, speaking isn't so bad. At least I'm in control of it. But listening … woah … people speak so fast and it's like my brain just shuts down. Am I just really strange and bad at listening? Tell me, honestly, I can take it.
Gabriella: No, you're not strange. In fact, it's really common. You know, in exams most people do pretty well in speaking compared with listening. Of course, exams are a different situation from real life because in an exam you can't ask for something to be repeated or explained. You usually have just one or maybe two opportunities to listen to the dialogue and then it's gone.
Presenter: Right, but in real life I feel stupid always saying, 'Sorry, can you repeat that, please?', especially if I still don't understand even when they repeat it. And people out there listening, I hope you don't do this – quite often the person just repeats what they said equally as fast and I'm still lost!
Gabriella: They do, don't they? In real life, you've got two strategies. One is to pretend to understand and get out of the conversation as fast as you can.
Presenter: Yep, sounds familiar!
Gabriella: But, obviously that's not going to help if it's a conversation with high stakes. It might have important consequences. I mean, if you're just chatting with a stranger at the bus stop, it doesn't matter. But imagine you're at a government office or a bank, trying to find out what paperwork you need to get your ID or open a bank account. What can you do then?
Presenter: I hope you've got the answer, Gabriella, because I'm coming out in a cold sweat just thinking about either of those situations!
Gabriella: The other strategy is to summarise what they said.
Presenter: But how can you do that if you didn't understand what they said?
Gabriella: Ah, well, you only start the summary, so you might say, in German in your case, 'OK, so the first thing I have to do is …?' and make it a question. Or, for example, 'And which office is that again?' Break it down into smaller questions and the other person will naturally start answering them. That way you're controlling the conversation a bit more.
Presenter: I get you ...



An introduction to a lecture
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first lecture of our new course in Positive Psychology. While some people may associate psychology with looking at what's wrong with us, and at what problems we have, there is much more to psychology than that. Positive psychology, for example, looks at how to help people become happier.
This lecture begins with a question: what makes a happy life?
Now, I'm going to give you one possible answer. A happy life is a life in which you are completely absorbed in what you do. Now, how does this compare with what you and your partner said? 
This answer comes from the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and the theory of flow. Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has spent much of his professional life on the study of what makes people happy and how we can find happiness.
Csikszentmihalyi suggests the theory that happiness is not caused by external events or things that happen to us. Our perception of these things and how we see these events either makes us happy or sad. In other words, if we want happiness, we have to actively look for it. However, this does not mean that we should always look for happiness! Csikszentmihalyi believed that our happiest moments happen when we are in a state of flow.
The theory of flow can be summarised like this: when we are totally involved in, or focused on, what we are doing, we are in a state of flow.
Csikszentmihalyi got the inspiration for this theory when he noticed how artists worked in a studio. They completely lost track of time, they didn't notice they were hungry or tired, and they could work for hours, even days, without stopping. Anyone I have spoken to who has experienced this state of concentration has said it's difficult to explain. The best way to explain it is that it is like being in a river and the flow of the water carries you away.
For the rest of this lecture, I will explore this theory of flow in more detail. First we will look at Csikszentmihalyi's life, and how it influenced his ideas. Then we will look at the conditions that go with a state of flow. What creates flow, exactly? Finally, we will look at activities that can help us achieve flow in our everyday lives. Will this course make you happy for life? Well, maybe. Maybe. 
Right, let's get started. If you look at the next slide …



Arriving late to class
Student 1: Sorry. Sorry, excuse me. I'm just … just coming to sit over here. Phew. Hey. How's it going? So, what have I missed?
Student 2: Nothing. He just started around five minutes ago.
Student 1: Did he say anything about the mid-term?
Student 2: What?
Student 1: About the mid-term tests. Did he say anything about when he was going to hand them back?
Student 2: He's almost finished marking them, he said. We get them next Tuesday.
Student 1: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. When do we get them?
Student 2: Tuesday. Next Tuesday.
Student 1: OK. Got it. Sorry. What page are we meant to be on?
Student 2: Page 34.
Student 1: Page … 34. Oh, wait. I don't have my textbook. Can I … share with you? Wow. This is hard stuff.
Student 2: Mmm.
Student 1: What does SEO mean?
Student 2: What?
Student 1: SEO. This is all about SEO but he hasn't said what it means.
Student 2: Search engine optimisation. How to appear on internet searches.
Student 1: Internet searches. Right. Right. OK.
Student 2: He said what it meant.
Student 1: What?
Student 2: He explained it before you got here.
Student 1: Oh. Right. OK.
Student 2: Can you be quiet? I'm trying to listen to the lecture.
Student 1: So am I. Sorry. Sorry, one more question. What does this have to do with the American Revolution?
Student 2: What?
Student 1: I don't get it. Why is he talking about search engines in a course on the American Revolution?
Student 2: What are you talking about? This is a class on software engineering.
Student 1: You mean, it's not Early American History?
Student 2: You're in the wrong class.
Student 1: Oh, wow. Now it all makes sense. I'm so sorry.
Student 2: It's fine. 
Student 1: Here, I'll just … excuse me. I'm in the wrong class. Excuse me. Thanks. Sorry.  



At the chemist
Chemist: Hello, can I help?
Customer: Yes, my wife sent me here. I, erm, need something for a sore throat … and I can't stop coughing. It really hurts.
Chemist: Do you have a headache too?
Customer: Not really, no.
Chemist: Well, we have this syrup. And these lozenges.
Customer: Which is better? 
Chemist: They're both good. The syrup is more expensive.
Customer: Oh, well … I'll take the lozenges, then. How many do I take?
Chemist: Just one.
Customer: Sorry, I'm sorry. Er, how often should I take it?
Chemist: Just one every four to six hours. Take it before mealtimes. Are you allergic to any medicine?
Customer: No.
Chemist: Then you'll be fine with this.
Customer: Can I get some antibiotics too?
Chemist: I'm afraid you need a prescription for that.
Customer: Ah.
Chemist: You know, you should really see a doctor if that cough continues.
Customer: Thanks. I know.
Chemist: Anything else?
Customer: No, thanks.
Chemist: That'll be £7.49 then, please.



Chatting about a series
Man: So, did you see the final episode last night?
Woman: Of course! As if I would miss that!
Man: And?
Woman: It was by far the best episode, definitely.
Man: Yeah, totally. The dragon at the end and all the special effects in that final scene were amazing.
Woman: I loved that part! But I still don't think this series was as good as the others.
Man: Really? But you said you wouldn't want to miss it?
Woman: I know, but still … it's a lot more predictable than it used to be.
Man: But that's because the story has been told so well that all the characters are reaching their destiny now.
Woman: I don't know … before, anyone could die at any time so it was exciting! But, this series, no key characters died and we all knew they wouldn't. When Jaime fell in the water after the dragon attacked him, we knew he would make it somehow. And … oh, surprise, Bronn jumps in and saves him.
Man: They did kill some characters in this series, though. What was that one's name …?
Woman: Exactly, see! You can't even remember who died!
Man: Hmm. The only thing I didn't like about this series was that it was shorter than the others. Seven episodes instead of ten. Maybe they spent all their money on that dragon!
Woman: Right! I don't understand why they did it, as all the fans would happily watch ten episodes.
Man: I reckon that now they're not using the story in the books any more, they don't have as many ideas.
Woman: That would explain why they're not being as brave with the story too. It's more like a Hollywood film than a TV show now.
Man: So, is Tyrion still your favourite character?
Woman: You know … surprisingly, I think my favourite might be Cersei.
Man: What?!
Woman: She's so interesting! All the awful things she's done and the way she's just aiming for revenge, even though it won't make her happy. She still surprises us because we're expecting her to have a happy ending where she sees her mistakes and becomes a good person. But she never does, no matter what it costs her. She's unpredictable because we just can't believe anyone would be like her.
Man: I guess. You don't have to like a character for them to be your favourite!



Making a decision
Jani: Thanks for coming, everyone. So, we're here today to define the timeline for our new project.
Emiko: Yes, Jani, that's a great idea.
Carolina: OK. What do you need from us?
Emiko: Hold on a moment. I think we need to decide between us what to do, to make sure it works for all departments.
Jani: Yes, exactly, don't worry. We're going to discuss this and make a decision together. Let's first think about the scheduling of each project phase. What do you think, Emiko?
David: Can I interrupt? I think we should first be clear about the process we'll use to make the decision. How are we going to do it?
Jani: Ah, yes. Good point. Well, I think the best way is for each of you to give your opinion and then we can discuss and make a decision.
David: OK. That sounds good.
Emiko: Yes, that works for me too. I know we're still planning the structure of the later phases of the project, but I think we should begin phase one as soon as possible. We can work out the rest later, as we go along.
David: I'm sorry, I don't think so. How can we start phase one if we're not fully clear on where the rest of the project will take us? We might make a wrong decision and waste time.
Jani: I agree with you on that point, David. However, we'll waste too much time if we wait until everything is planned before we actually start working on the project. I think we should take an agile approach.
David: Agile approach?
Jani: Well, it means that we start quickly and then adapt as we go along.
Emiko: That's right.
Jani: Carolina, you've been very quiet.
Carolina: Um … I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt. I'm listening … and thinking.
David: Do you agree we should get the plan right first, and then start with phase one?
Carolina: I'm sorry, David. I don't think I agree with you. It's important to have a good plan. But plans can change, even the good ones – and business changes often. We need to be flexible, and we also need to move quickly.
Jani: OK. So should we take a vote?
Emiko: Well, you're the project leader. Let's go with your decision.
Carolina: Yes, I'll follow your lead, Jani.
David: Well, I guess that's decided then. We'll follow your agile approach, Jani. Start quickly and keep planning the later stages of the project.
Jani: Yes, that's right.
David: I still don't think this is the right decision, but I'm happy to go with the majority. We should add some space into the schedule later for additional work this 'flexibility' will need.
Jani: Don't worry, David, we will. OK, so it's decided then. We'll start phase one as soon as possible, and in the background we'll continue planning the later phases and adapt them as we go along.



Meeting an old friend
Selina: Patrick? Is that you?
Patrick: Selina! Hello!
Selina: Well, well. Patrick Eastwood. How have you been?
Patrick: Good. Great, actually. How are you? I haven't seen you for ... how long?
Selina: It's been ages. At least fifteen years. Wow.
Patrick: Yeah. Wow.
Patrick and Selina: So, what are you doing here?
Selina: Sorry, you go first.
Patrick: OK. What are you doing here? I thought you'd moved to London.
Selina: I was in London for a couple of years. But it didn't work out.
