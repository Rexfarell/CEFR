Fourteen-year-old Neil Atkins talks about working on a house-building project in the United States.
I got involved in the house-building project through my Uncle Brian. We went to stay with him in the United States for six weeks during the summer holiday. He was helping out on the project and asked me to come along. At first I wasn’t interested. I was enjoying watching lots of new channels on TV! But after a while I got bored and went along to see what he was doing.  I realised that what he was doing was really great!
He was helping out for an organisation that builds houses for people who can’t usually afford them. Instead, the organisation buys all the wood and bricks and things you need to build a house. It lends the family the tools and hires some guys who know what they’re doing. They also get people like my uncle, who aren’t builders but who just want to help out in the community, to do the more simple building jobs. The family eventually pay all the money back to the organisation, but they can do this over many years, and it’s much cheaper than buying a new house.
I helped out with moving dirt and preparing tea. It was a bit disappointing that I wasn’t allowed to use the tools and do jobs like cutting wood and nailing things together. I understand why they do it, but do design and technology at school so I know I could do it right. Some people had no idea how to use a hammer correctly!  But if I go back next year, I’ll be able to do it, because I’ll be fifteen then.
