Teen Voice
No journalists write for Teen
Voice. This magazine depends
completely on articles sent in by
its teenage readers. It gives young
people the opportunity to publish
their creative work, such as poems
or short works of fiction or to
voice their opinions on important
issues. They can also write
reviews of the latest music CDs.
