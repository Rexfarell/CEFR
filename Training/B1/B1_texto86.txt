Joe,
In my country, there are many holidays thoughout
the year, but the traditional holiday is Tet holiday. It’s
also the most important holiday. It occurs in late
January, early in February. At that time, every family
clean and decorate their houses. It’s also an occasion
for people who live far away from their home to gather
and enjoy the exciting atmosphere with their family.
They prepare so much food, especially is sticky-rice, it
is made from sticky rice with meat and peas,
Vietnamese people call “barh chung”. At Tet, young
children receive many red envelopes with lucky money
inside. People wish best wishes to their relatives and
friends. Vietnamese people love it too much. Do you like
it? Is it interesting and exciting?
Write me soon.
Your friend
