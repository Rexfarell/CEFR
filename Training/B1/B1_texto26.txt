Interview with Henry Smiles
He’s the most popular member of one of the most popular bands in the world. We met Two Direction’s Henry Smiles to find out why he has so many female fans.
Let’s get the basic questions out of the way first, Henry. How old are you and where are you from?
I was born in 1996 and I’m from Harrogate in the north of England. Now I live in London.
What are your likes and dislikes?
Well, I love music, of course, and sleeping and eating. And my dislikes? I don’t like it when I’m late for things.
What are your favourite films?
Spider-Man 2 and X-Men were pretty cool.
Is there anything that you’d like to be able to do?
I wish I could play the drums and the piano.
You are famous for your great hair. Would you cut it or shave it off?
Maybe I’d shave it off for charity, if I could raise a lot of money for doing it.
Do you like social networking?
Well, I don’t go on Facebook very much, but I do use Twitter a lot. It’s a good way to keep in touch with our fans.
Now the more interesting questions! Have you got a girlfriend, Henry?
No, not at the moment. I’m single!
What kind of girls do you like?
I like girls with a good sense of humour, who don’t take life too seriously. I also like being able to call someone in the middle of the night for a chat if I need to.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
Oh, I like both! If we can have a laugh and we get on well, I don't care what colour hair they have.
Are you romantic when you’re in a relationship?
I reckon I am. I’d do anything for love!
Who did you have your first kiss with?
My first kiss? Hmm, I can’t remember very clearly, but I think it was with a girl at school when I was about thirteen.
Tell us a secret, Henry.
I still get really nervous before a concert and have to drink herbal tea! Even today, after having done hundreds of concerts, my hands sweat and my heart beats really fast just before going on stage.
