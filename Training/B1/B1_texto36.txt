O' Connell Street
O'Connell Street is the main thoroughfare and is one of the busiest shopping streets in Dublin. Even though it is not a very long street, the locals will proudly tell the visitor that it is the widest street in all of Europe. This claim often meets with protests, especially from French people, claiming the Champs Elysees of Paris as Europe's widest street. But the witty Irishman won't easily relinquish bragging rights and will trump the French visitor with a fine distinction: The Champs Elysees is an avenue; O'Connell is a street. Divided by a few important monuments running the length of its centre, the street is named after Daniel O'Connell, an Irish patriot. His monument stands at the lower end of the road, facing O'Connell Bridge. O'Connell stands high above the business people, unhurried crowds of shoppers and students on a big column, surrounded by four angels representing Patriotism, Courage, Eloquence and Fidelity. Further up the street on the other side is the famous General Post Office or the GPO as Dubliners call it. During the Easter Rising of 1916, the GPO was taken over by the Irish Volunteers on Easter Monday and occupied by the revolutionary forces, sparking weeks of armed combat in the heart of Dublin. To this day, three of the angels bear bullet holes - two with a wound in the chest and one in its left arm.
