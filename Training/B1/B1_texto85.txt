Jo
Jo looked at the map and decided to go left. He
realised he was alone in the desert. He couldn’t imagine
what would happen to him. A pair of poisonus snakes
were in front of him, and he decided to escape, but the
two creatures were always opposite him. Suddenly he
saw a person walking on the sand, which shouted to
Jo, who was very frightened. Jo ran as fast as he
could and he reached the man. They stopped walking
after two minutes because they saw a car, but the
snakes reached Jo, they bit him and … Jo woke up. It
was only a dream.
