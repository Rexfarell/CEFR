Teenplus
Teenplus is very different from the
average teen magazine that simply offers
articles on pop stars and fashion. This
exciting new magazine informs readers
about what is happening in the world
through its in-depth articles on current
affairs, politics and science. It also
offers a variety of reviews on recent
books, films and music CDs.
